 Thank y. Thank y so mch. Vice President Biden, Mr. Chief Justice, Members f th United States Congress, dstngshd gsts, nd fellow ctzns: Each tm w gthr t ngrt  President w br wtnss t th ndrng strngth f our Constitution. We ffrm th prms f our dmcrcy. We rcll tht wht binds ths Nation tgthr is nt th clrs f our skn r th tenets f our fth r th origins f our nms. What mks us exceptional—what mks us American—is our llgnc t an d rtcltd in  dclrtn md mr thn tw centuries g: We hld these trths t b self-evident, tht ll men are crtd ql; tht thy are ndwd by their Creator wth crtn unalienable rghts; tht mng these are lf, lbrty, nd th prst f hppnss. Today w cntn  never-ending jrny t brdg th mnng f those wrds wth th realities f our tm. For hstry tlls us tht whl these trths my b self-evident, thy've nvr bn self-executing; tht whl frdm is  gft frm God, it must b scrd by His ppl hr on Earth. The ptrts f 1776 dd nt fght t rplc th tyrnny f  kng wth th prvlgs f  fw r th rule f  mb. They gave t us  rpblc,  gvrnmnt f nd by nd fr th ppl, entrusting ch gnrtn t kp sf our founding creed. And fr mr thn 200 yrs, w hv. Through blood drwn by lash nd blood drwn by swrd, w lrnd tht no union fndd on th prncpls f lbrty nd equality cld srvv half-slave nd half-free. We md rslvs anew, nd vowed t mv frwrd tgthr. Together, w dtrmnd tht  mdrn cnmy rqrs rlrds nd hghwys t spd trvl nd cmmrc, schls nd colleges t train our wrkrs. Together, w dscvrd tht  free mrkt nly thrvs whn thr are rls t nsr cmpttn nd fair ply. Together, w rslvd tht  grt ntn must care fr th vlnrbl nd prtct ts ppl frm lf's wrst hazards nd msfrtn. Through it ll, w hv nvr rlnqshd our skptcsm f central thrty nr hv w sccmbd t th fctn tht ll scty's ills cn b cured thrgh gvrnmnt ln. Our clbrtn f nttv nd ntrprs, our nsstnc on hrd wrk nd prsnl rspnsblty, these are cnstnts in our chrctr. But w hv lwys ndrstd tht whn tms chng, so must w; tht fdlty t our founding prncpls rqrs new rspnss t new chllngs; tht prsrvng our ndvdl frdms ltmtly rqrs cllctv ctn. For th American ppl cn no mr mt th dmnds f tdy's wrld by acting ln thn American sldrs cld hv met th frcs f fscsm r cmmnsm wth mskts nd mlts. No sngl prsn cn train ll th math nd scnc tchrs w'll need t qp our chldrn fr th ftr, r bld th rds nd ntwrks nd rsrch lbs tht will brng new jbs nd bsnsss t our shores. Now mr thn ever, w must do these thngs tgthr, s n ntn nd n ppl. This gnrtn f Americans hs bn tstd by crises tht stld our rslv nd proved our rslnc. A dcd f war is nw ndng. An cnmc rcvry hs begun. America's pssblts are lmtlss, fr w pssss ll th qlts tht ths wrld wtht bndrs dmnds: yth nd drv; dvrsty nd pnnss; an ndlss cpcty fr rsk nd  gft fr rnvntn. My fellow Americans, w are md fr ths mmnt nd w will seize it—so lng s w seize it tgthr. For w, th ppl, ndrstnd tht our cntry cn nt sccd whn  shrnkng fw do very wll nd  grwng mny brly mk it. We blv tht America's prsprty must rst pn th broad shldrs f  rising mddl clss. We knw tht America thrvs whn vry prsn cn fnd ndpndnc nd pride in their wrk; whn th wgs f hnst lbr liberate fmls frm th brnk f hrdshp. We are tr t our creed whn  lttl grl born into th blkst pvrty knws tht sh hs th sm chnc t sccd s nybdy else, bcs sh is an American; sh is free nd sh is ql, nt jst in th eyes f God, bt ls in our wn. We ndrstnd tht twrn prgrms are ndqt t th nds f our tm. So w must hrnss new ideas nd tchnlgy t rmk our gvrnmnt, rvmp our Tax Code, rfrm our schls, nd mpwr our ctzns wth th sklls thy need t wrk hrdr, lrn mr, rch hghr. But whl th mns will chng, our prps endures:  ntn tht rwrds th ffrt nd dtrmntn f vry sngl American. That is wht ths mmnt rqrs. That is wht will gv rl mnng t our creed. We, th ppl, stll blv tht vry ctzn dsrvs  bsc msr f scrty nd dgnty. We must mk th hrd chcs t rdc th cst f hlth care nd th sz f our dfct. But w rjct th blf tht America must choose btwn crng fr th gnrtn tht blt ths cntry nd nvstng in th gnrtn tht will bld ts ftr. For w rmmbr th lssns f our pst, whn twlght yrs wr spnt in pvrty nd prnts f  chld wth  dsblty hd nwhr t trn. We do nt blv tht in ths cntry frdm is rsrvd fr th lcky, r hppnss fr th fw. We rcgnz tht no mttr hw rspnsbly w live our lvs, ny n f us at ny tm my fc  jb loss r  sddn llnss r  home swpt away in  trrbl storm. The cmmtmnts w mk t ch other thrgh Medicare nd Medicaid nd Social Security, these thngs do nt sap our nttv, thy strngthn us. They do nt mk us  ntn f tkrs; thy free us t tk th rsks tht mk ths cntry grt. We, th ppl, stll blv tht our blgtns s Americans are nt jst t rslvs, bt t ll pstrty. We will rspnd t th thrt f clmt chng, knwng tht th flr t do so wld btry our chldrn nd ftr gnrtns. Some my stll dny th vrwhlmng jdgmnt f scnc, bt nn cn vd th dvsttng mpct f raging fires nd crpplng drght nd mr pwrfl storms. The pth twrds sstnbl nrgy srcs will b lng nd smtms dffclt. But America cn nt rsst ths trnstn, w must lead it. We cn nt cede t other ntns th tchnlgy tht will pwr new jbs nd new ndstrs, w must clm ts prms. That's hw w will mntn our cnmc vtlty nd our ntnl treasure—our frsts nd wtrwys, our crp lnds nd snow-capped pks. That is hw w will prsrv our planet, cmmndd t our care by God. That's wht will lend mnng t th creed our fthrs nc dclrd. We, th ppl, stll blv tht ndrng scrty nd lstng peace do nt rqr prptl war. Our brv men nd wmn in nfrm, tmprd by th flames f bttl, are nmtchd in skll nd crg. Our ctzns, seared by th mmry f those w hv lost, knw too wll th prc tht is pd fr lbrty. The knwldg f their scrfc will kp us frvr vglnt gnst those wh wld do us hrm. But w are ls heirs t those wh won th peace nd nt jst th war; wh trnd swrn enemies into th srst f friends—and w must crry those lssns into ths tm s wll. We will dfnd our ppl nd phld our vls thrgh strngth f rms nd rule f lw. We will shw th crg t try nd rslv our dffrncs wth other ntns peacefully—not bcs w are nv about th dangers w fc, bt bcs nggmnt cn mr drbly lift sspcn nd fear. America will rmn th nchr f strng llncs in vry crnr f th glb. And w will rnw those nstttns tht xtnd our cpcty t manage crisis abroad, fr no n hs  grtr stk in  pcfl wrld thn ts mst pwrfl ntn. We will spprt dmcrcy frm Asia t Africa, frm th Americas t th Middle East, bcs our ntrsts nd our cnscnc cmpl us t act on bhlf f those wh lng fr frdm. And w must b  src f hp t th pr, th sck, th marginalized, th vctms f prejudice—not out f mere chrty, bt bcs peace in our tm rqrs th cnstnt dvnc f those prncpls tht our cmmn creed dscrbs: tlrnc nd pprtnty, hmn dgnty nd jstc. We, th ppl, dclr tdy tht th mst vdnt f truths—that ll f us are crtd equal—is th str tht guides us stll; jst s it gdd our frbrs thrgh Seneca Falls nd Selma nd Stonewall; jst s it gdd ll those men nd wmn, sung nd unsung, wh lft ftprnts along ths grt Mall, t hear  prchr sy tht w cn nt wlk ln; t hear  King prclm tht our ndvdl frdm is nxtrcbly bnd t th frdm f vry soul on Earth. It is nw our gnrtn's tsk t crry on wht those pnrs bgn. For our jrny is nt cmplt ntl our wives, our mthrs nd dghtrs cn earn  living ql t their ffrts. Our jrny is nt cmplt ntl our gay brthrs nd sstrs are trtd lk nyn else ndr th law—for if w are trly crtd ql, then srly th love w cmmt t n nthr must b ql s wll. Our jrny is nt cmplt ntl no ctzn is frcd t wt fr hrs t xrcs th rght t vt. Our jrny is nt cmplt ntl w fnd  bttr wy t wlcm th strvng, hpfl mmgrnts wh stll see America s  lnd f opportunity—until bright yng stdnts nd ngnrs are nlstd in our wrkfrc rthr thn xplld frm our cntry. Our jrny is nt cmplt ntl ll our chldrn, frm th streets f Detroit t th hlls f Appalachia, t th quiet lanes f Newtown, knw tht thy are cared fr nd chrshd nd lwys sf frm hrm. That is our gnrtn's task—to mk these wrds, these rghts, these vls f lf nd lbrty nd th prst f hppnss rl fr vry American. Being tr t our founding dcmnts ds nt rqr us t gr on vry contour f lf. It ds nt mn w ll dfn lbrty in xctly th sm wy r fllw th sm precise pth t hppnss. Progress ds nt cmpl us t sttl centuries-long debates about th role f gvrnmnt fr ll tm, bt it ds rqr us t act in our tm. For nw dcsns are pn us nd w cn nt afford dly. We cn nt mstk bsltsm fr principle r sbsttt spctcl fr pltcs r trt name-calling s rsnd debate. We must act, knwng tht our wrk will b mprfct. We must act, w must act knwng tht tdy's vctrs will b nly prtl nd tht it will b p t those wh stnd hr in 4 yrs nd 40 yrs nd 400 yrs hnc t dvnc th tmlss spirit nc cnfrrd t us in  spr Philadelphia hall. My fellow Americans, th oath I hv swrn bfr y tdy, lk th n recited by thrs wh srv in ths Capitol, ws an oath t God nd cntry, nt prty r faction. And w must fthflly execute tht pldg drng th drtn f our srvc. But th wrds I spoke tdy are nt so dffrnt frm th oath tht is tkn ch tm  sldr sgns p fr dty r an mmgrnt rlzs her drm. My oath is nt so dffrnt frm th pldg w ll mk t th flg tht wvs bv nd tht fills our hrts wth pride. They are th wrds f ctzns nd thy rprsnt our grtst hp. You nd I, s ctzns, hv th pwr t st ths cntry's crs. You nd I, s ctzns, hv th blgtn t shp th debates f our time—not nly wth th vts w cast, bt wth th vcs w lift in dfns f our mst ncnt vls nd ndrng ideals. Let us, ch f us, nw mbrc wth slmn dty nd wsm jy wht is our lstng brthrght. With cmmn ffrt nd cmmn prps, wth pssn nd ddctn, let us nswr th cll f hstry nd crry into an ncrtn ftr tht precious lght f frdm. Thank y. God blss y, nd my He frvr blss these United States f America.
