From th cmmncmnt f our Revolution t th prsnt dy lmst frty yrs hv elapsed, nd frm th stblshmnt f ths Constitution twenty-eight. Through ths whole trm th Government hs bn wht my mphtclly b clld self-government. And wht hs bn th ffct? To whtvr bjct w trn our ttntn, whthr it relates t our frgn r dmstc cncrns, w fnd bndnt cause t felicitate rslvs in th xcllnc f our nstttns. During  prd fraught wth dffclts nd mrkd by very xtrrdnry vnts th United States hv flrshd bynd xmpl. Their ctzns ndvdlly hv bn hppy nd th ntn prsprs. Under ths Constitution our cmmrc hs bn wsly rgltd wth frgn ntns nd btwn th States; new States hv bn dmttd into our Union; our trrtry hs bn nlrgd by fair nd hnrbl trty, nd wth grt dvntg t th rgnl States; th States, rspctvly prtctd by th National Government ndr  mld, prntl systm gnst frgn dangers, nd njyng wthn their sprt sphrs, by  wise prttn f pwr,  jst proportion f th svrgnty, hv mprvd their police, xtndd their sttlmnts, nd attained  strngth nd mtrty whch are th bst prfs f whlsm lws wll dmnstrd. And if w look t th cndtn f ndvdls wht  proud spctcl ds it xhbt! On whm hs pprssn flln in ny qrtr f our Union? Who hs bn dprvd f ny rght f prsn r prprty? Who rstrnd frm ffrng his vows in th mode whch h prfrs t th Divine Author f his bng? It is wll knwn tht ll these blssngs hv bn njyd in their fllst xtnt; nd I add wth pclr stsfctn tht thr hs bn no xmpl f  cptl pnshmnt bng nflctd on nyn fr th crm f hgh trsn. Some wh mght dmt th cmptncy f our Government t these bnfcnt dts mght dbt it in trls whch pt t th tst ts strngth nd ffcncy s  mmbr f th grt cmmnty f ntns. Here too xprnc hs ffrdd us th mst stsfctry prf in ts fvr. Just s ths Constitution ws pt into ctn svrl f th prncpl States f Europe hd bcm mch agitated nd some f thm srsly cnvlsd. Destructive wars ensued, whch hv f late nly bn trmntd. In th crs f these cnflcts th United States rcvd grt njry frm svrl f th parties. It ws their ntrst t stnd aloof frm th cntst, t dmnd jstc frm th prty cmmttng th njry, nd t cltvt by  fair nd hnrbl cndct th frndshp f ll. War became at lngth nvtbl, nd th rslt hs shwn tht our Government is ql t tht, th grtst f trls, ndr th mst nfvrbl crcmstncs. Of th vrt f th ppl nd f th hrc xplts f th Army, th Navy, nd th militia I need nt spk. Such, then, is th hppy Government ndr whch w live-- Government dqt t vry prps fr whch th scl cmpct is frmd;  Government lctv in ll ts brnchs, ndr whch vry ctzn my by his mrt btn th hghst trst rcgnzd by th Constitution; whch contains wthn it no cause f discord, nn t pt at vrnc n prtn f th cmmnty wth nthr;  Government whch prtcts vry ctzn in th fll njymnt f his rghts, nd is bl t prtct th ntn gnst njstc frm frgn pwrs. Other cnsdrtns f th hghst mprtnc admonish us t chrsh our Union nd t cling t th Government whch spprts it. Fortunate s w are in our pltcl nstttns, w hv nt bn lss so in other crcmstncs on whch our prsprty nd hppnss ssntlly dpnd. Situated wthn th tmprt zn, nd xtndng thrgh mny dgrs f latitude along th Atlantic, th United States njy ll th vrts f clmt, nd vry prdctn ncdnt t tht prtn f th glb. Penetrating ntrnlly t th Great Lakes nd bynd th srcs f th grt rivers whch cmmnct thrgh our whole ntrr, no cntry ws ever hppr wth rspct t ts dmn. Blessed, too, wth  frtl soil, our prdc hs lwys bn very bndnt, lvng, vn in yrs th lst fvrbl,  srpls fr th wnts f our fellow-men in other cntrs. Such is our pclr flcty tht thr is nt  prt f our Union tht is nt prtclrly ntrstd in prsrvng it. The grt grcltrl ntrst f th ntn prospers ndr ts prtctn. Local ntrsts are nt lss fstrd by it. Our fellow-citizens f th North nggd in nvgtn fnd grt ncrgmnt in bng md th fvrd crrrs f th vst prdctns f th other portions f th United States, whl th nhbtnts f these are amply rcmpnsd, in their trn, by th nrsry fr seamen nd naval frc thus frmd nd reared p fr th spprt f our cmmn rghts. Our mnfctrs fnd  gnrs ncrgmnt by th plcy whch ptrnzs dmstc ndstry, nd th srpls f our prdc  steady nd prftbl mrkt by lcl wnts in lss fvrd prts at home. Such, then, bng th hghly fvrd cndtn f our cntry, it is th ntrst f vry ctzn t mntn it. What are th dangers whch menace us? If ny xst thy ought t b scrtnd nd grdd gnst. In xplnng my sntmnts on ths sbjct it my b skd, What rsd us t th prsnt hppy stt? How dd w ccmplsh th Revolution? How rmdy th defects f th frst nstrmnt f our Union, by nfsng into th National Government sffcnt pwr fr ntnl prpss, wtht impairing th jst rghts f th States r ffctng those f ndvdls? How sstn nd pss wth glry thrgh th late war? The Government hs bn in th hnds f th ppl. To th ppl, thrfr, nd t th fthfl nd bl depositaries f their trst is th crdt due. Had th ppl f th United States bn dctd in dffrnt prncpls hd thy bn lss ntllgnt, lss ndpndnt, r lss virtuous cn it b blvd tht w shld hv mntnd th sm steady nd cnsstnt crr r bn blssd wth th sm sccss? While, then, th cnsttnt bdy rtns ts prsnt sound nd hlthfl stt vrythng will b sf. They will choose cmptnt nd fthfl rprsnttvs fr vry dprtmnt. It is nly whn th ppl bcm gnrnt nd crrpt, whn thy dgnrt into  pplc, tht thy are ncpbl f xrcsng th svrgnty. Usurpation is then an easy ttnmnt, nd an srpr soon found. The ppl thmslvs bcm th wllng nstrmnts f their wn dbsmnt nd ruin. Let us, then, look t th grt cause, nd ndvr t prsrv it in fll frc. Let us by ll wise nd cnstttnl msrs prmt ntllgnc mng th ppl s th bst mns f prsrvng our lbrts. Dangers frm abroad are nt lss dsrvng f ttntn. Experiencing th frtn f other ntns, th United States my b gn nvlvd in war, nd it my in tht vnt b th bjct f th adverse prty t overset our Government, t brk our Union, nd dmlsh us s  ntn.

Many f our ctzns are nggd in cmmrc nd nvgtn, nd ll f thm are in  crtn dgr dpndnt on their prsprs stt. Many are nggd in th fshrs. These ntrsts are xpsd t nvsn in th wars btwn other pwrs, nd w shld dsrgrd th fthfl admonition f xprnc if w dd nt xpct it. We must spprt our rghts r lose our chrctr, nd wth it, prhps, our lbrts.

But it ought lwys t b held prominently in vw tht th sfty f these States nd f vrythng dear t  free ppl must dpnd in an mnnt dgr on th militia.

By thus fclttng th ntrcrs btwn th States w shll add mch t th cnvnnc nd cmfrt f our fellow-citizens, mch t th rnmnt f th cntry, nd, wht is f grtr mprtnc, w shll shrtn dstncs, nd, by mkng ch prt mr ccssbl t nd dpndnt on th other, w shll bind th Union mr clsly tgthr. Nature hs dn so mch fr us by ntrsctng th cntry wth so mny grt rivers, bays, nd lakes, pprchng frm dstnt pnts so near t ch other, tht th ndcmnt t cmplt th wrk sms t b pclrly strng. A mr ntrstng spctcl ws prhps nvr sn thn is xhbtd wthn th lmts f th United States-- trrtry so vst nd dvntgsly situated, containing bjcts so grand, so sfl, so hpply cnnctd in ll their prts!

These rsrcs, bsds ccmplshng vry other ncssry prps, pt it cmpltly in th pwr f th United States t dschrg th ntnl debt at an rly prd. Peace is th bst tm fr mprvmnt nd prprtn f vry knd; it is in peace tht our cmmrc flrshs mst, tht taxes are mst sly pd, nd tht th rvn is mst prdctv. The Executive is chrgd ffclly in th Departments ndr it wth th dsbrsmnt f th pblc money, nd is rspnsbl fr th fthfl pplctn f it t th prpss fr whch it is rsd.

Equally grtfyng is it t wtnss th ncrsd hrmny f pnn whch pervades our Union. Discord ds nt blng t our systm.

To prmt ths hrmny in ccrd wth th prncpls f our rpblcn Government nd in  mnnr t gv thm th mst cmplt ffct, nd t dvnc in ll other rspcts th bst ntrsts f our Union, will b th bjct f my cnstnt nd zls xrtns.
