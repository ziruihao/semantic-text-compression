 My fellow ctzns, no ppl on rth hv mr cause t b thnkfl thn ours, nd ths is said rvrntly, in no spirit f bstflnss in our wn strngth, bt wth grttd t th Giver f Good wh hs blssd us wth th cndtns whch hv nbld us t chv so lrg  msr f well-being nd f hppnss. To us s  ppl it hs bn grntd t ly th fndtns f our ntnl lf in  new cntnnt. We are th heirs f th ages, nd yt w hv hd t py fw f th pnlts whch in old cntrs are exacted by th dead hnd f  bygn cvlztn. We hv nt bn blgd t fght fr our xstnc gnst ny alien rc; nd yt our lf hs clld fr th vgr nd ffrt wtht whch th manlier nd hardier virtues wither away. Under sch cndtns it wld b our wn fault if w fld; nd th sccss whch w hv hd in th pst, th sccss whch w cnfdntly blv th ftr will brng, shld cause in us no feeling f vnglry, bt rthr  dp nd bdng rlztn f ll whch lf hs ffrd us;  fll cknwldgmnt f th rspnsblty whch is ours; nd  fxd dtrmntn t shw tht ndr  free gvrnmnt  mghty ppl cn thrv bst, alike s rgrds th thngs f th bdy nd th thngs f th soul. Much hs bn gvn us, nd mch will rghtflly b xpctd frm us. We hv duties t thrs nd duties t rslvs; nd w cn shirk neither. We hv bcm  grt ntn, frcd by th fct f ts grtnss into rltns wth th other ntns f th rth, nd w must bhv s beseems  ppl wth sch rspnsblts. Toward ll other ntns, lrg nd smll, our tttd must b n f cordial nd sncr frndshp. We must shw nt nly in our wrds, bt in our deeds, tht w are rnstly desirous f scrng their gd will by acting twrd thm in  spirit f jst nd gnrs rcgntn f ll their rghts. But jstc nd gnrsty in  ntn, s in an ndvdl, cnt mst whn shwn nt by th weak bt by th strng. While ever crfl t rfrn frm wrngdng thrs, w must b no lss nsstnt tht w are nt wrngd rslvs. We wsh peace, bt w wsh th peace f jstc, th peace f rghtsnss. We wsh it bcs w thnk it is rght nd nt bcs w are frd. No weak ntn tht acts mnflly nd jstly shld ever hv cause t fear us, nd no strng pwr shld ever b bl t sngl us out s  sbjct fr nslnt ggrssn. Our rltns wth th other pwrs f th wrld are mprtnt; bt stll mr mprtnt are our rltns mng rslvs. Such grwth in wlth, in ppltn, nd in pwr s ths ntn hs sn drng th century nd  qrtr f ts ntnl lf is nvtbly ccmpnd by  lk grwth in th prblms whch are ever bfr vry ntn tht rises t grtnss. Power nvrbly mns bth rspnsblty nd dngr. Our frfthrs fcd crtn perils whch w hv tgrwn. We nw fc other perils, th very xstnc f whch it ws mpssbl tht thy shld foresee. Modern lf is bth cmplx nd intense, nd th trmnds chngs wrought by th xtrrdnry ndstrl dvlpmnt f th last hlf century are flt in vry fbr f our scl nd pltcl bng. Never bfr hv men trd so vst nd frmdbl an xprmnt s tht f dmnstrng th affairs f  cntnnt ndr th frms f  Democratic rpblc. The cndtns whch hv tld fr our mrvls mtrl well-being, whch hv dvlpd t  very hgh dgr our nrgy, self-reliance, nd ndvdl nttv, hv ls brght th care nd nxty nsprbl frm th ccmltn f grt wlth in ndstrl centers. Upon th sccss f our xprmnt mch dpnds, nt nly s rgrds our wn wlfr, bt s rgrds th wlfr f mnknd. If w fail, th cause f free self-government thrght th wrld will rck t ts fndtns, nd thrfr our rspnsblty is hvy, t rslvs, t th wrld s it is tdy, nd t th gnrtns yt nbrn. There is no gd rsn why w shld fear th ftr, bt thr is vry rsn why w shld fc it srsly, neither hiding frm rslvs th grvty f th prblms bfr us nr fearing t pprch these prblms wth th nbndng, nflnchng prps t slv thm aright. Yet, after ll, thgh th prblms are new, thgh th tsks st bfr us dffr frm th tsks st bfr our fthrs wh fndd nd prsrvd ths Republic, th spirit in whch these tsks must b ndrtkn nd these prblms fcd, if our dty is t b wll dn, rmns ssntlly nchngd. We knw tht self-government is dffclt. We knw tht no ppl nds sch hgh traits f chrctr s tht ppl whch sks t gvrn ts affairs aright thrgh th freely xprssd will f th freemen wh compose it. But w hv fth tht w shll nt prv false t th mmrs f th men f th mghty pst. They dd their wrk, thy lft us th splndd hrtg w nw njy. We in our trn hv an ssrd cnfdnc tht w shll b bl t lv ths hrtg unwasted nd nlrgd t our chldrn nd our chldrn's chldrn. To do so w must shw, nt mrly in grt crises, bt in th vrydy affairs f lf, th qlts f prctcl ntllgnc, f crg, f hardihood, nd ndrnc, nd bv ll th pwr f dvtn t  lfty ideal, whch md grt th men wh fndd ths Republic in th dys f Washington, whch md grt th men wh prsrvd ths Republic in th dys f Abraham Lincoln.
