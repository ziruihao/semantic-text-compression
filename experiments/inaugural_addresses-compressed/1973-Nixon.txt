 Mr. Vice President, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chief Justice, Senator Cook, Mrs. Eisenhower, nd my fellow ctzns f ths grt nd gd cntry w shr tgthr: When w met hr four yrs g, America ws bleak in spirit, dprssd by th prspct f smngly ndlss war abroad nd f dstrctv cnflct at home. As w mt hr tdy, w stnd on th thrshld f  new era f peace in th wrld. The central qstn bfr us is: How shll w use tht peace? Let us rslv tht ths era w are about t enter will nt b wht other pstwr prds hv so ftn bn:  tm f rtrt nd isolation tht lds t stgntn at home nd nvts new dngr abroad. Let us rslv tht ths will b wht it cn bcm:  tm f grt rspnsblts grtly borne, in whch w rnw th spirit nd th prms f America s w enter our thrd century s  ntn. This pst yr sw far-reaching rslts frm our new policies fr peace. By cntnng t rvtlz our trdtnl frndshps, nd by our mssns t Peking nd t Moscow, w wr bl t stblsh th bs fr  new nd mr drbl pttrn f rltnshps mng th ntns f th wrld. Because f America's bold nttvs, 1972 will b lng rmmbrd s th yr f th grtst prgrss snc th end f World War II twrd  lstng peace in th wrld. The peace w sk in th wrld is nt th flmsy peace whch is mrly an ntrld btwn wars, bt  peace whch cn endure fr gnrtns t cm. It is mprtnt tht w ndrstnd bth th ncssty nd th lmttns f America's role in mntnng tht peace. Unless w in America wrk t prsrv th peace, thr will b no peace. Unless w in America wrk t prsrv frdm, thr will b no frdm. But let us clrly ndrstnd th new nature f America's role, s  rslt f th new policies w hv dptd vr these pst four yrs. We shll rspct our trty cmmtmnts. We shll spprt vgrsly th principle tht no cntry hs th rght t mps ts will r rule on nthr by frc. We shll cntn, in ths era f ngttn, t wrk fr th lmttn f nuclear rms, nd t rdc th dngr f cnfrnttn btwn th grt pwrs. We shll do our shr in dfndng peace nd frdm in th wrld. But w shll xpct thrs t do their shr. The tm hs pssd whn America will mk vry other ntn's cnflct our wn, r mk vry other ntn's ftr our rspnsblty, r prsm t tll th ppl f other ntns hw t manage their wn affairs. Just s w rspct th rght f ch ntn t dtrmn ts wn ftr, w ls rcgnz th rspnsblty f ch ntn t scr ts wn ftr. Just s America's role is ndspnsbl in prsrvng th wrld's peace, so is ch ntn's role ndspnsbl in prsrvng ts wn peace. Together wth th rst f th wrld, let us rslv t mv frwrd frm th bgnnngs w hv md. Let us cntn t brng dwn th wlls f hstlty whch hv dvdd th wrld fr too lng, nd t bld in their plc brdgs f ndrstndng--so tht dspt prfnd dffrncs btwn systms f gvrnmnt, th ppl f th wrld cn b frnds. Let us bld  strctr f peace in th wrld in whch th weak are s sf s th strng--in whch ch rspcts th rght f th other t live by  dffrnt systm--in whch those wh wld nflnc thrs will do so by th strngth f their ideas, nd nt by th frc f their rms. Let us ccpt tht hgh rspnsblty nt s  brdn, bt gldly--gldly bcs th chnc t bld sch  peace is th nblst ndvr in whch  ntn cn ngg; gldly, ls, bcs nly if w act grtly in mtng our rspnsblts abroad will w rmn  grt Nation, nd nly if w rmn  grt Nation will w act grtly in mtng our chllngs at home. We hv th chnc tdy t do mr thn ever bfr in our hstry t mk lf bttr in America--t nsr bttr dctn, bttr hlth, bttr hsng, bttr trnsprttn,  clnr nvrnmnt--t rstr rspct fr lw, t mk our cmmnts mr livable--nd t insure th God-given rght f vry American t fll nd ql pprtnty. Because th rng f our nds is so grt--bcs th rch f our pprtnts is so grt--let us b bold in our dtrmntn t mt those nds in new wys. Just s bldng  strctr f peace abroad hs rqrd trnng away frm old policies tht fld, so bldng  new era f prgrss at home rqrs trnng away frm old policies tht hv fld. Abroad, th shft frm old policies t new hs nt bn  rtrt frm our rspnsblts, bt  bttr wy t peace. And at home, th shft frm old policies t new will nt b  rtrt frm our rspnsblts, bt  bttr wy t prgrss. Abroad nd at home, th ky t those new rspnsblts lies in th plcng nd th dvsn f rspnsblty. We hv lvd too lng wth th cnsqncs f ttmptng t gthr ll pwr nd rspnsblty in Washington. Abroad nd at home, th tm hs cm t trn away frm th cndscndng policies f ptrnlsm--f "Washington knws bst." A prsn cn b xpctd t act rspnsbly nly if h hs rspnsblty. This is hmn nature. So let us ncrg ndvdls at home nd ntns abroad t do mr fr thmslvs, t decide mr fr thmslvs. Let us lct rspnsblty in mr plcs. Let us msr wht w will do fr thrs by wht thy will do fr thmslvs. That is why tdy I ffr no prms f  purely gvrnmntl sltn fr vry prblm. We hv lvd too lng wth tht false prms. In trstng too mch in gvrnmnt, w hv skd f it mr thn it cn dlvr. This lds nly t nfltd xpcttns, t rdcd ndvdl ffrt, nd t  dsppntmnt nd frstrtn tht erode cnfdnc bth in wht gvrnmnt cn do nd in wht ppl cn do. Government must lrn t tk lss frm ppl so tht ppl an do mr fr thmslvs. Let us rmmbr tht America ws blt nt by gvrnmnt, bt by ppl--nt by wlfr, bt by wrk--nt by shirking rspnsblty, bt by skng rspnsblty. In our wn lvs, let ch f us ask--nt jst wht will gvrnmnt do fr me, bt wht cn I do fr myslf? In th chllngs w fc tgthr, let ch f us ask--nt jst hw cn gvrnmnt hlp, bt hw cn I hlp? Your National Government hs  grt nd vtl role t ply. And I pldg t y tht whr ths Government shld act, w will act bldly nd w will lead bldly. But jst s mprtnt is th role tht ch nd vry n f us must ply, s an ndvdl nd s  mmbr f his wn cmmnty. From ths dy frwrd, let ch f us mk  slmn cmmtmnt in his wn hrt: t br his rspnsblty, t do his prt, t live his ideals--so tht tgthr, w cn see th dawn f  new age f prgrss fr America, nd tgthr, s w clbrt our 200th nnvrsry s  ntn, w cn do so proud in th flfllmnt f our prms t rslvs nd t th wrld. As America's lngst nd mst dffclt war cms t an end, let us gn lrn t debate our dffrncs wth cvlty nd dcncy. And let ch f us rch out fr tht n precious qlty gvrnmnt cn nt prvd-- new lvl f rspct fr th rghts nd flngs f n nthr,  new lvl f rspct fr th ndvdl hmn dgnty whch is th chrshd brthrght f vry American. Above ll else, th tm hs cm fr us t rnw our fth in rslvs nd in America. In rcnt yrs, tht fth hs bn chllngd. Our chldrn hv bn taught t b shmd f their cntry, shmd f their prnts, shmd f America's rcrd at home nd f ts role in th wrld. At vry trn, w hv bn beset by those wh fnd vrythng wrng wth America nd lttl tht is rght. But I am cnfdnt tht ths will nt b th jdgmnt f hstry on these rmrkbl tms in whch w are prvlgd t live. America's rcrd in ths century hs bn nprllld in th wrld's hstry fr ts rspnsblty, fr ts gnrsty, fr ts crtvty nd fr ts prgrss. Let us b proud tht our systm hs prdcd nd prvdd mr frdm nd mr bndnc, mr wdly shrd, thn ny other systm in th hstry f th wrld. Let us b proud tht in ch f th four wars in whch w hv bn nggd in ths century, ncldng th n w are nw brngng t an end, w hv fought nt fr our slfsh dvntg, bt t hlp thrs rsst ggrssn. Let us b proud tht by our bold, new nttvs, nd by our stdfstnss fr peace wth hnr, w hv md  break-through twrd crtng in th wrld wht th wrld hs nt knwn bfr-- strctr f peace tht cn last, nt mrly fr our tm, bt fr gnrtns t cm. We are mbrkng hr tdy on an era tht prsnts chllngs grt s those ny ntn, r ny gnrtn, hs ever fcd. We shll nswr t God, t hstry, nd t our cnscnc fr th wy in whch w use these yrs. As I stnd in ths plc, so hllwd by hstry, I thnk f thrs wh hv std hr bfr me. I thnk f th drms thy hd fr America, nd I thnk f hw ch rcgnzd tht h needed hlp far bynd hmslf in rdr t mk those drms cm tr. Today, I ask your pryrs tht in th yrs ahead I my hv God's hlp in mkng dcsns tht are rght fr America, nd I pry fr your hlp so tht tgthr w my b wrthy f our chllng. Let us pldg tgthr t mk these nxt four yrs th bst four yrs in America's hstry, so tht on ts 200th brthdy America will b s yng nd s vtl s whn it began, nd s bright  bcn f hp fr ll th wrld. Let us go frwrd frm hr cnfdnt in hp, strng in our fth in n nthr, sstnd by our fth in God wh crtd us, nd strvng lwys t srv His prps.
