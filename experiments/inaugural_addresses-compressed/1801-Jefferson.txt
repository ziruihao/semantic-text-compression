 Friends nd Fellow Citizens: Called pn t ndrtk th dts f th frst xctv ffc f our cntry, I avail myslf f th prsnc f tht prtn f my fellow ctzns whch is hr ssmbld t xprss my grtfl thnks fr th fvr wth whch thy hv bn plsd t look twrd me, t dclr  sncr cnscsnss tht th tsk is bv my tlnts, nd tht I pprch it wth those nxs nd wfl presentiments whch th grtnss f th chrg nd th wknss f my pwrs so jstly nspr. A rising ntn, sprd vr  wd nd frtfl lnd, trvrsng ll th seas wth th rich prdctns f their ndstry, nggd in cmmrc wth ntns wh fl pwr nd frgt rght, dvncng rpdly t dstns bynd th rch f mortal eye--whn I cntmplt these trnscndnt bjcts, nd see th hnr, th hppnss, nd th hps f ths beloved cntry cmmttd t th ss, nd th auspices f ths dy, I shrnk frm th cntmpltn, nd hmbl myslf bfr th mgntd f th ndrtkng. Utterly, ndd, shld I dspr dd nt th prsnc f mny whm I hr see remind me tht in th other hgh thrts prvdd by our Constitution I shll fnd rsrcs f wsdm, f vrt, nd f zl on whch t rely ndr ll dffclts. To y, then, gentlemen, wh are chrgd wth th svrgn fnctns f lgsltn, nd t those ssctd wth y, I look wth ncrgmnt fr tht gdnc nd spprt whch my enable us t steer wth sfty th vssl in whch w are ll mbrkd amidst th cnflctng lmnts f  trbld wrld. During th cntst f pnn thrgh whch w hv pssd th nmtn f dscssns nd f xrtns hs smtms worn an spct whch mght mps on strngrs unused t thnk freely nd t spk nd t wrt wht thy thnk; bt ths bng nw dcdd by th vc f th ntn, nnncd ccrdng t th rls f th Constitution, ll will, f crs, rrng thmslvs ndr th will f th lw, nd unite in cmmn ffrts fr th cmmn gd. All, too, will br in mnd ths sacred principle, tht thgh th will f th mjrty is in ll css t prvl, tht will t b rghtfl must b rsnbl; tht th mnrty pssss their ql rghts, whch ql lw must prtct, nd t violate wld b pprssn. Let us, then, fellow ctzns, unite wth n hrt nd n mnd. Let us rstr t scl ntrcrs tht hrmny nd ffctn wtht whch lbrty nd vn lf tslf are bt drry thngs. And let us rflct tht, hvng bnshd frm our lnd tht rlgs ntlrnc ndr whch mnknd so lng bled nd sffrd, w hv yt gnd lttl if w cntnnc  pltcl ntlrnc s dsptc, s wckd, nd cpbl f s bitter nd bldy persecutions. During th throes nd cnvlsns f th ncnt wrld, drng th gnzng spsms f nfrtd man, skng thrgh blood nd slghtr his long-lost lbrty, it ws nt wndrfl tht th agitation f th billows shld rch vn ths dstnt nd pcfl shore; tht ths shld b mr flt nd feared by some nd lss by thrs, nd shld dvd pnns s t msrs f sfty. But vry dffrnc f pnn is nt  dffrnc f principle. We hv clld by dffrnt nms brthrn f th sm principle. We are ll Republicans, w are ll Federalists. If thr b ny mng us wh wld wsh t dsslv ths Union r t chng ts rpblcn form, let thm stnd ndstrbd s mnmnts f th sfty wth whch rrr f pnn my b tlrtd whr rsn is lft free t cmbt it. I knw, ndd, tht some hnst men fear tht  rpblcn gvrnmnt cn nt b strng, tht ths Government is nt strng ngh; bt wld th hnst ptrt, in th fll tide f sccssfl xprmnt, bndn  gvrnmnt whch hs so far kpt us free nd firm on th thrtc nd vsnry fear tht ths Government, th wrld's bst hp, my by pssblty wnt nrgy t prsrv tslf? I trst nt. I blv ths, on th cntrry, th strngst Government on rth. I blv it th nly n whr vry man, at th cll f th lw, wld fly t th stndrd f th lw, nd wld mt invasions f th pblc rdr s his wn prsnl cncrn. Sometimes it is said tht man cn nt b trstd wth th gvrnmnt f hmslf. Can h, then, b trstd wth th gvrnmnt f thrs? Or hv w found angels in th frms f kngs t gvrn hm? Let hstry nswr ths qstn. Let us, then, wth crg nd cnfdnc prs our wn Federal nd Republican prncpls, our ttchmnt t union nd rprsnttv gvrnmnt. Kindly sprtd by nature nd  wd ocean frm th xtrmntng hvc f n qrtr f th glb; too high-minded t endure th dgrdtns f th thrs; pssssng  chsn cntry, wth rm ngh fr our dscndnts t th thsndth nd thsndth gnrtn; ntrtnng  due sns f our ql rght t th use f our wn faculties, t th cqstns f our wn ndstry, t hnr nd cnfdnc frm our fellow ctzns, rsltng nt frm brth, bt frm our ctns nd their sns f thm; nlghtnd by  bngn rlgn, prfssd, ndd, nd prctcd in vrs frms, yt ll f thm nclctng hnsty, trth, tmprnc, grttd, nd th love f man; cknwldgng nd adoring an vrrlng Providence, whch by ll ts dspnstns proves tht it dlghts in th hppnss f man hr nd his grtr hppnss hrftr--wth ll these blssngs, wht mr is ncssry t mk us  hppy nd  prsprs ppl?

This is th sum f gd gvrnmnt, nd ths is ncssry t cls th circle f our felicities. About t enter, fellow-citizens, on th xrcs f dts whch cmprhnd vrythng dear nd valuable t y, it is prpr y shld ndrstnd wht I deem th ssntl prncpls f our Government, nd cnsqntly those whch ought t shp ts Administration.
