 The Price f Peace Mr. Chairman, Mr. Vice President, Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. Speaker, mmbrs f my fmly nd frnds, my cntrymn, nd th frnds f my cntry, whrvr thy my b, w mt gn, s pn  lk mmnt four yrs g, nd gn y hv wtnssd my slmn oath f srvc t y. I, too, am  wtnss, tdy tstfyng in your nm t th prncpls nd prpss t whch w, s  ppl, are pldgd. Before ll else, w sk, pn our cmmn lbr s  ntn, th blssngs f Almighty God. And th hps in our hrts fshn th deepest pryrs f our whole ppl. May w prs th rght--wtht self-righteousness. May w knw nty--wtht cnfrmty. May w grow in strngth--wtht pride in slf. May w, in our dlngs wth ll peoples f th rth, ever spk trth nd srv jstc. And so shll America--in th sight f ll men f gd will--prv tr t th hnrbl prpss tht bind nd rule us s  ppl in ll ths tm f trl thrgh whch w pss. We live in  lnd f plnty, bt rrly hs ths rth knwn sch peril s tdy. In our ntn wrk nd wlth abound. Our ppltn grws. Commerce crwds our rivers nd rails, our skies, hrbrs, nd hghwys. Our soil is frtl, our grcltr prdctv. The air rngs wth th song f our ndstry--rllng mlls nd blst furnaces, dynms, dams, nd ssmbly lns--th chrs f America th bntfl. This is our home--yt ths is nt th whole f our wrld. For our wrld is whr our fll dstny lies--wth men, f ll ppl, nd ll ntns, wh are r wld b free. And fr thm--nd so fr us--ths is no tm f ease r f rst. In too mch f th rth thr is wnt, discord, dngr. New frcs nd new ntns stir nd strv crss th rth, wth pwr t brng, by their fate, grt gd r grt evil t th free wrld's ftr. From th dsrts f North Africa t th slnds f th South Pacific n thrd f ll mnknd hs ntrd pn an hstrc strggl fr  new frdm; frdm frm grndng pvrty. Across ll cntnnts, nrly  blln ppl sk, smtms lmst in dsprtn, fr th sklls nd knwldg nd ssstnc by whch thy my stsfy frm their wn rsrcs, th mtrl wnts cmmn t ll mnknd. No ntn, hwvr old r grt, scps ths tmpst f chng nd trml. Some, mpvrshd by th rcnt World War, sk t rstr their mns f lvlhd. In th hrt f Europe, Germany stll stnds trgclly dvdd. So is th whole cntnnt dvdd. And so, too, is ll th wrld. The dvsv frc is International Communism nd th pwr tht it cntrls. The dsgns f tht pwr, drk in prps, are clr in prctc. It strvs t seal frvr th fate f those it hs enslaved. It strvs t brk th ties tht unite th free. And it strvs t cptr--t xplt fr ts wn grtr pwr--ll frcs f chng in th wrld, spclly th nds f th hngry nd th hps f th pprssd. Yet th wrld f International Communism hs tslf bn shkn by  fierce nd mghty frc: th rdnss f men wh love frdm t pldg their lvs t tht love. Through th nght f their bondage, th ncnqrbl will f heroes hs strck wth th swft, shrp thrst f lghtnng. Budapest is no lngr mrly th nm f  cty; hncfrth it is  new nd shnng symbl f man's yrnng t b free. Thus crss ll th glb thr hrshly blow th winds f chng. And, w--thgh frtnt b our lt--knw tht w cn nvr trn our bcks t thm. We look pn ths shkn rth, nd w dclr our firm nd fxd prps--th bldng f  peace wth jstc in  wrld whr mrl lw prvls. The bldng f sch  peace is  bold nd slmn prps. To prclm it is easy. To srv it will b hrd. And t attain it, w must b aware f ts fll mnng--nd rdy t py ts fll prc. We knw clrly wht w sk, nd why. We sk peace, knwng tht peace is th clmt f frdm. And nw, s in no other age, w sk it bcs w hv bn wrnd, by th pwr f mdrn wpns, tht peace my b th nly clmt pssbl fr hmn lf tslf. Yet ths peace w sk cn nt b born f fear ln: it must b rtd in th lvs f ntns. There must b jstc, snsd nd shrd by ll peoples, fr, wtht jstc th wrld cn knw nly  tense nd nstbl truce. There must b lw, stdly nvkd nd rspctd by ll ntns, fr wtht lw, th wrld prmss nly sch mgr jstc s th pty f th strng pn th weak. But th lw f whch w spk, cmprhndng th vls f frdm, ffrms th equality f ll ntns, grt nd smll. Splendid s cn b th blssngs f sch  peace, hgh will b ts cst: in toil ptntly sstnd, in hlp hnrbly gvn, in scrfc clmly borne. We are clld t mt th prc f ths peace. To cntr th thrt f those wh sk t rule by frc, w must py th csts f our wn needed mltry strngth, nd hlp t bld th scrty f thrs. We must use our sklls nd knwldg nd, at tms, our sbstnc, t hlp thrs rise frm msry, hwvr far th scn f sffrng my b frm our shores. For whrvr in th wrld  ppl knws dsprt wnt, thr must ppr at lst th sprk f hp, th hp f prgrss--r thr will srly rise at last th flames f cnflct. We rcgnz nd ccpt our wn dp nvlvmnt in th dstny f men vrywhr. We are ccrdngly pldgd t hnr, nd t strv t frtfy, th thrty f th United Nations. For in tht bdy rsts th bst hp f our age fr th ssrtn f tht lw by whch ll ntns my live in dgnty. And, bynd ths gnrl rslv, w are clld t act  rspnsbl role in th wrld's grt cncrns r cnflcts--whthr thy tch pn th affairs f  vst rgn, th fate f an slnd in th Pacific, r th use f  cnl in th Middle East. Only in rspctng th hps nd cltrs f thrs will w prctc th equality f ll ntns. Only s w shw wllngnss nd wsdm in gvng cnsl--in rcvng cnsl--nd in shrng brdns, will w wsly prfrm th wrk f peace. For n trth must rule ll w thnk nd ll w do. No ppl cn live t tslf ln. The nty f ll wh dwll in frdm is their nly sr dfns. The cnmc need f ll ntns--in mtl dpndnc--mks isolation an mpssblty; nt vn America's prsprty cld lng srvv if other ntns dd nt ls prspr. No ntn cn lngr b  frtrss, lone nd strng nd sf. And ny ppl, skng sch shltr fr thmslvs, cn nw bld nly their wn prison. Our pldg t these prncpls is cnstnt, bcs w blv in their rghtnss. We do nt fear ths wrld f chng. America is no stranger t mch f ts spirit. Everywhere w see th seeds f th sm grwth tht America tslf hs knwn. The American xprmnt hs, fr gnrtns, fired th pssn nd th crg f mllns lswhr skng frdm, equality, nd pprtnty. And th American stry f mtrl prgrss hs hlpd excite th lngng f ll needy peoples fr some stsfctn f their hmn wnts. These hps tht w hv hlpd t nspr, w cn hlp t flfll. In ths cnfdnc, w spk plnly t ll peoples. We chrsh our frndshp wth ll ntns tht are r wld b free. We rspct, no lss, their ndpndnc. And whn, in tm f wnt r peril, thy ask our hlp, thy my hnrbly rcv it; fr w no mr sk t buy their svrgnty thn w wld sll our wn. Sovereignty is nvr brtrd mng freemen. We hnr th sprtns f those ntns whch, nw cptv, lng fr frdm. We sk neither their mltry llnc nr ny rtfcl mttn f our scty. And thy cn knw th wrmth f th wlcm tht awaits thm whn, s must b, thy jn gn th rnks f frdm. We hnr, no lss in ths dvdd wrld thn in  lss tormented tm, th ppl f Russia. We do nt dread, rthr do w wlcm, their prgrss in dctn nd ndstry. We wsh thm sccss in their dmnds fr mr ntllctl frdm, grtr scrty bfr their wn lws, fllr njymnt f th rwrds f their wn toil. For s sch thngs cm t pss, th mr crtn will b th cmng f tht dy whn our peoples my freely mt in frndshp. So w vc our hp nd our blf tht w cn hlp t heal ths dvdd wrld. Thus my th ntns cease t live in trmblng bfr th menace f frc. Thus my th wght f fear nd th wght f rms b tkn frm th brdnd shldrs f mnknd. This, nthng lss, is th lbr t whch w are clld nd our strngth ddctd. And so th pryr f our ppl crrs far bynd our wn frntrs, t th wd wrld f our dty nd our dstny. May th lght f frdm, cmng t ll drknd lnds, flame brghtly--ntl at last th drknss is no mr. May th trblnc f our age yld t  tr tm f peace, whn men nd ntns shll shr  lf tht hnrs th dgnty f ch, th brthrhd f ll.
