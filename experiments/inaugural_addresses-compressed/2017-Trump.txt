This American carnage stops rght hr nd stops rght nw. We are n Nation, nd their pain is our pain, their drms are our drms, nd their sccss will b our sccss. We shr n hrt, n home, nd n glrs dstny. The oath f ffc I tk tdy is an oath f llgnc t ll Americans.

We, ssmbld hr tdy, are ssng  new dcr t b heard in vry cty, in vry frgn cptl, nd in vry hall f pwr. From ths dy frwrd,  new vsn will gvrn our lnd. From ths ths dy frwrd, it's gng t b nly America frst. America frst. Every dcsn on trade, on txs, on mmgrtn, on frgn affairs, will b md t bnft American wrkrs nd American fmls. We must prtct our brdrs frm th rvgs f other cntrs mkng our prdcts, stlng our cmpns, nd dstryng our jbs. Protection will lead t grt prsprty nd strngth.

The Bible tlls us, "How gd nd plsnt it is whn God's ppl live tgthr in nty." We must spk our mnds pnly, debate our dsgrmnts hnstly, bt lwys prs sldrty. When America is ntd, America is ttlly nstppbl.

We stnd at th brth f  new mllnnm, rdy t nlck th mysteries f spc, t free th Earth frm th miseries f dss, nd t hrnss th nrgs, ndstrs, nd tchnlgs f tmrrw. A new ntnl pride will stir our souls, lift our sghts, nd heal our dvsns. It's tm t rmmbr tht old wsdm our sldrs will nvr frgt: tht whthr w are Black r Brown r White, w ll bleed th sm red blood f ptrts, w ll njy th sm glrs frdms, nd w ll salute th sm grt American flg. And whthr  chld is born in th rbn sprwl f Detroit r th wndswpt plains f Nebraska, thy look p at th sm nght sky, thy fill their hrt wth th sm drms, nd thy are nfsd wth th breath f lf by th sm lmghty Creator. So t ll Americans in vry cty near nd far, smll nd lrg, frm mountain t mountain, frm ocean t ocean, hear these wrds: You will nvr b gnrd gn. Your vc, your hps, nd your drms will dfn our American dstny. And your crg nd gdnss nd love will frvr guide us along th wy. Together, w will mk America strng gn. We will mk America wlthy gn. We will mk America proud gn. We will mk America sf gn. And, ys, tgthr, w will mk America grt gn. Thank y. God blss y, nd God blss America. Thank y. God blss America.
