For their pprbtn f my pblc cndct thrgh  prd whch hs nt bn wtht ts dffclts, nd fr ths rnwd xprssn f their cnfdnc in my gd ntntns, I am at  loss fr trms dqt t th xprssn f my grttd. It shll b dsplyd t th xtnt f my hmbl blts in cntnd ffrts so t dmnstr th Government s t prsrv their lbrty nd prmt their hppnss. So mny vnts hv ccrrd wthn th last four yrs whch hv ncssrly clld frth--smtms ndr crcmstncs th mst dlct nd pnfl--my vws f th prncpls nd plcy whch ought t b prsd by th General Government tht I need on ths ccsn bt allude t  fw ldng cnsdrtns cnnctd wth some f thm. The frgn plcy dptd by our Government soon after th frmtn f our prsnt Constitution, nd very gnrlly prsd by sccssv Administrations, hs bn crwnd wth lmst cmplt sccss, nd hs lvtd our chrctr mng th ntns f th rth. To do jstc t ll nd t sbmt t wrng frm nn hs bn drng my Administration ts gvrnng mxm, nd so hppy hv bn ts rslts tht w are nt nly at peace wth ll th wrld, bt hv fw causes f cntrvrsy, nd those f mnr mprtnc, rmnng ndjstd. In th dmstc plcy f ths Government thr are tw bjcts whch spclly dsrv th ttntn f th ppl nd their rprsnttvs, nd whch hv bn nd will cntn t b th sbjcts f my ncrsng solicitude. They are th prsrvtn f th rghts f th svrl States nd th ntgrty f th Union. These grt bjcts are ncssrly cnnctd, nd cn nly b attained by an nlghtnd xrcs f th pwrs f ch wthn ts pprprt sphr in cnfrmty wth th pblc will cnstttnlly xprssd. To ths end it bcms th dty f ll t yld  rdy nd ptrtc sbmssn t th lws cnstttnlly nctd nd thrby prmt nd strngthn  prpr cnfdnc in those nstttns f th svrl States nd f th United States whch th ppl thmslvs hv rdnd fr their wn gvrnmnt. My xprnc in pblc cncrns nd th bsrvtn f  lf smwht dvncd cnfrm th pnns lng snc imbibed by me, tht th dstrctn f our State gvrnmnts r th nnhltn f their cntrl vr th lcl cncrns f th ppl wld lead drctly t rvltn nd nrchy, nd fnlly t dsptsm nd mltry dmntn. In proportion, thrfr, s th General Government ncrchs pn th rghts f th States, in th sm proportion ds it impair ts wn pwr nd dtrct frm ts blty t flfll th prpss f ts creation. Solemnly mprssd wth these cnsdrtns, my cntrymn will ever fnd me rdy t xrcs my cnstttnl pwrs in rrstng msrs whch my drctly r ndrctly ncrch pn th rghts f th States r tnd t cnsldt ll pltcl pwr in th General Government. But f ql nd, ndd, f nclclbl, mprtnc is th union f these States, nd th sacred dty f ll t cntrbt t ts prsrvtn by  lbrl spprt f th General Government in th xrcs f ts jst pwrs. You hv bn wsly admonished t "ccstm yrslvs t thnk nd spk f th Union s f th plldm f your pltcl sfty nd prsprty, wtchng fr ts prsrvtn wth Jealous nxty, discountenancing whtvr my sggst vn  sspcn tht it cn in ny vnt b bndnd, nd ndgnntly frwnng pn th frst dawning f ny ttmpt t alienate ny prtn f our cntry frm th rst r t enfeeble th sacred ties whch nw lnk tgthr th vrs prts." Without union our ndpndnc nd lbrty wld nvr hv bn chvd; wtht union thy nvr cn b mntnd. Divided into twenty-four, r vn  smllr nmbr, f sprt cmmnts, w shll see our ntrnl trade brdnd wth nmbrlss restraints nd exactions; cmmnctn btwn dstnt pnts nd sctns bstrctd r ct ff; our sons md sldrs t deluge wth blood th flds thy nw till in peace; th mss f our ppl borne dwn nd mpvrshd by txs t spprt armies nd nvs, nd mltry ldrs at th head f their victorious lgns bcmng our lwgvrs nd jdgs. The loss f lbrty, f ll gd gvrnmnt, f peace, plnty, nd hppnss, must nvtbly fllw  dssltn f th Union. In spprtng it, thrfr, w spprt ll tht is dear t th frmn nd th phlnthrpst The tm at whch I stnd bfr y is fll f ntrst. The eyes f ll ntns are fxd on our Republic. The vnt f th xstng crisis will b dcsv in th pnn f mnknd f th prctcblty f our fdrl systm f gvrnmnt. Great is th stk plcd in our hnds; grt is th rspnsblty whch must rst pn th ppl f th United States. Let us rlz th mprtnc f th tttd in whch w stnd bfr th wrld. Let us xrcs frbrnc nd frmnss. Let us extricate our cntry frm th dangers whch srrnd it nd lrn wsdm frm th lssns thy nclct. Deeply mprssd wth th trth f these bsrvtns, nd ndr th blgtn f tht slmn oath whch I am about t tk, I shll cntn t xrt ll my faculties t mntn th jst pwrs f th Constitution nd t trnsmt nmprd t pstrty th blssngs f our Federal Union. At th sm tm, it will b my m t nclct by my ffcl acts th ncssty f xrcsng by th General Government those pwrs nly tht are clrly dlgtd; t ncrg smplcty nd cnmy in th xpndtrs f th Government; t rs no mr money frm th ppl thn my b requisite fr these bjcts, nd in  mnnr tht will bst prmt th ntrsts f ll clsss f th cmmnty nd f ll portions f th Union. Constantly bearing in mnd tht in ntrng into scty "ndvdls must gv p  shr f lbrty t prsrv th rst," it will b my dsr so t dschrg my dts s t foster wth our brthrn in ll prts f th cntry  spirit f lbrl cncssn nd cmprms, nd, by rcnclng our fellow ctzns t those prtl scrfcs whch thy must nvdbly mk fr th prsrvtn f  grtr gd, t rcmmnd our invaluable Government nd Union t th cnfdnc nd ffctns f th American ppl. Finally, it is my mst frvnt pryr t tht Almighty Being bfr whm I nw stnd, nd wh hs kpt us in His hnds frm th nfncy f our Republic t th prsnt dy, tht He will so vrrl ll my ntntns nd ctns nd nspr th hrts f my fellow ctzns tht w my b prsrvd frm dangers f ll knds nd cntn frvr  ntd nd hppy ppl.
