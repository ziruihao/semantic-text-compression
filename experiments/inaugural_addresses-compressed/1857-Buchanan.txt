 Fellow ctzns, I ppr bfr y ths dy t tk th slmn oath "tht I will fthflly execute th ffc f President f th United States nd will t th bst f my blty prsrv, prtct, nd dfnd th Constitution f th United States." In ntrng pn ths grt ffc I must hmbly nvk th God f our fthrs fr wsdm nd frmnss t execute ts hgh nd rspnsbl dts in sch  mnnr s t rstr hrmny nd ncnt frndshp mng th ppl f th svrl States nd t prsrv our free nstttns thrght mny gnrtns. Convinced tht I owe my election t th nhrnt love fr th Constitution nd th Union whch stll animates th hrts f th American ppl, let me rnstly ask their pwrfl spprt in sstnng ll jst msrs clcltd t prptt these, th rchst pltcl blssngs whch Heaven hs ever bstwd pn ny ntn. Having dtrmnd nt t bcm  cnddt fr reelection, I shll hv no mtv t nflnc my cndct in dmnstrng th Government xcpt th dsr ably nd faithfull t srv my cntry nd t live in grtfl mmry f my cntrymn. We hv rcntly pssd thrgh  Presidential cntst in whch th pssns f our fellow-citizens wr excited t th hghst dgr by qstns f dp nd vtl mprtnc; bt whn th ppl prclmd their will th tmpst at nc sbsdd nd ll ws calm. The vc f th mjrty, spkng in th mnnr prscrbd by th Constitution, ws heard, nd nstnt sbmssn fllwd. Our wn cntry cld ln hv xhbtd so grand nd strkng  spctcl f th cpcty f man fr self-government. What  hppy cncptn, then, ws it fr Congress t pply ths smpl rule, tht th will f th mjrty shll gvrn, t th sttlmnt f th qstn f dmstc slvry in th Territories. Congress is neither "t lgslt slvry into ny Territory r State nr t xcld it thrfrm, bt t lv th ppl thrf prfctly free t form nd rglt their dmstc nstttns in their wn wy, sbjct nly t th Constitution f th United States." As  ntrl cnsqnc, Congress hs ls prscrbd tht whn th Territory f Kansas shll b dmttd s  State it "shll b rcvd into th Union wth r wtht slvry, s their cnstttn my prscrb at th tm f their dmssn." A dffrnc f pnn hs arisen in rgrd t th pnt f tm whn th ppl f  Territory shll decide ths qstn fr thmslvs. This is, hpply,  mttr f bt lttl prctcl mprtnc. Besides, it is  jdcl qstn, whch lgtmtly blngs t th Supreme Court f th United States, bfr whm it is nw pndng, nd will, it is ndrstd, b spdly nd fnlly sttld. To their dcsn, in cmmn wth ll gd ctzns, I shll chrflly sbmt, whtvr ths my b, thgh it hs ever bn my ndvdl pnn tht ndr th Nebraska-Kansas act th pprprt prd will b whn th nmbr f ctl rsdnts in th Territory shll jstfy th frmtn f  cnstttn wth  vw t ts dmssn s  State into th Union. But b ths s it my, it is th mprtv nd ndspnsbl dty f th Government f th United States t scr t vry rsdnt nhbtnt th free nd ndpndnt xprssn f his pnn by his vt. This sacred rght f ch ndvdl must b prsrvd. That bng ccmplshd, nthng cn b frr thn t lv th ppl f  Territory free frm ll frgn ntrfrnc t decide their wn dstny fr thmslvs, sbjct nly t th Constitution f th United States. The whole Territorial qstn bng thus sttld pn th principle f pplr svrgnty-- principle s ncnt s free gvrnmnt tslf--vrythng f  prctcl nature hs bn dcdd. No other qstn rmns fr djstmnt, bcs ll gr tht ndr th Constitution slvry in th States is bynd th rch f ny hmn pwr xcpt tht f th rspctv States thmslvs whrn it xsts. May w nt, then, hp tht th lng agitation on ths sbjct is pprchng ts end, nd tht th ggrphcl parties t whch it hs gvn brth, so mch drdd by th Father f his Country, will spdly bcm xtnct? Most hppy will it b fr th cntry whn th pblc mnd shll b dvrtd frm ths qstn t thrs f mr prssng nd prctcl mprtnc. Throughout th whole prgrss f ths agitation, whch hs scrcly knwn ny ntrmssn fr mr thn twnty yrs, whlst it hs bn prdctv f no pstv gd t ny hmn bng it hs bn th prlfc src f grt evils t th mstr, t th slave, nd t th whole cntry. It hs lntd nd strngd th ppl f th sstr States frm ch other, nd hs vn srsly ndngrd th very xstnc f th Union. Nor hs th dngr yt ntrly ceased. Under our systm thr is  rmdy fr ll mere pltcl evils in th sound sns nd sbr jdgmnt f th ppl. Time is  grt crrctv. Political sbjcts whch bt  fw yrs g excited nd xsprtd th pblc mnd hv pssd away nd are nw nrly frgttn. But ths qstn f dmstc slvry is f far graver mprtnc thn ny mere pltcl qstn, bcs shld th agitation cntn it my vntlly ndngr th prsnl sfty f  lrg prtn f our cntrymn whr th nstttn xsts. In tht vnt no form f gvrnmnt, hwvr dmrbl in tslf nd hwvr prdctv f mtrl bnfts, cn cmpnst fr th loss f peace nd dmstc scrty rnd th fmly altar. Let vry Union-loving man, thrfr, xrt his bst nflnc t spprss ths agitation, whch snc th rcnt lgsltn f Congress is wtht ny lgtmt bjct. It is an evil omen f th tms tht men hv ndrtkn t clclt th mere mtrl vl f th Union. Reasoned stmts hv bn prsntd f th pcnry prfts nd lcl dvntgs whch wld rslt t dffrnt States nd sctns frm ts dssltn nd f th cmprtv njrs whch sch an vnt wld nflct on other States nd sctns. Even dscndng t ths low nd nrrw vw f th mghty qstn, ll sch clcltns are at fault. The bare rfrnc t  sngl cnsdrtn will b cnclsv on ths pnt. We at prsnt njy  free trade thrght our xtnsv nd xpndng cntry sch s th wrld hs nvr wtnssd. This trade is cndctd on rlrds nd cnls, on noble rivers nd rms f th sea, whch bind tgthr th North nd th South, th East nd th West, f our Confederacy. Annihilate ths trade, rrst ts free prgrss by th ggrphcl lns f jealous nd hstl States, nd y dstry th prsprty nd onward mrch f th whole nd vry prt nd nvlv ll in n cmmn ruin. But sch cnsdrtns, mprtnt s thy are in thmslvs, snk into nsgnfcnc whn w rflct on th trrfc evils whch wld rslt frm dsnn t vry prtn f th Confederacy--t th North, nt mr thn t th South, t th East nt mr thn t th West. These I shll nt ttmpt t prtry, bcs I fl an hmbl cnfdnc tht th knd Providence whch nsprd our fthrs wth wsdm t frame th mst prfct form f gvrnmnt nd union ever devised by man will nt sffr it t perish ntl it shll hv bn pcflly nstrmntl by ts xmpl in th xtnsn f cvl nd rlgs lbrty thrght th wrld. Next in mprtnc t th mntnnc f th Constitution nd th Union is th dty f prsrvng th Government free frm th taint r vn th sspcn f crrptn. Public vrt is th vtl spirit f rpblcs, nd hstry proves tht whn ths hs dcyd nd th love f money hs srpd ts plc, lthgh th frms f free gvrnmnt my rmn fr  ssn, th sbstnc hs dprtd frvr. Our prsnt fnncl cndtn is wtht  prlll in hstry. No ntn hs ever bfr bn mbrrssd frm too lrg  srpls in ts trsry. This lmst ncssrly gvs brth t xtrvgnt lgsltn. It prdcs wild schms f xpndtr nd bgts  rc f spcltrs nd jbbrs, whs ngnty is xrtd in cntrvng nd prmtng xpdnts t btn pblc money. The purity f ffcl gnts, whthr rghtflly r wrngflly, is sspctd, nd th chrctr f th gvrnmnt sffrs in th stmtn f th ppl. This is in tslf  very grt evil. The ntrl mode f rlf frm ths mbrrssmnt is t pprprt th srpls in th Treasury t grt ntnl bjcts fr whch  clr wrrnt cn b found in th Constitution. Among these I mght mention th xtngshmnt f th pblc debt,  rsnbl ncrs f th Navy, whch is at prsnt ndqt t th prtctn f our vst tonnage afloat, nw grtr thn tht f ny other ntn, s wll s t th dfns f our xtndd scst. It is bynd ll qstn th tr principle tht no mr rvn ought t b cllctd frm th ppl thn th amount ncssry t dfry th xpnss f  wise, cnmcl, nd ffcnt dmnstrtn f th Government. To rch ths pnt it ws ncssry t rsrt t  mdfctn f th trff, nd ths hs, I trst, bn ccmplshd in sch  mnnr s t do s lttl njry s my hv bn prctcbl t our dmstc mnfctrs, spclly those ncssry fr th dfns f th cntry. Any dscrmntn gnst  prtclr brnch fr th prps f bnftng fvrd crprtns, ndvdls, r ntrsts wld hv bn njst t th rst f th cmmnty nd ncnsstnt wth tht spirit f frnss nd equality whch ought t gvrn in th djstmnt f  rvn trff. But th sqndrng f th pblc money sinks into cmprtv nsgnfcnc s  tmpttn t crrptn whn cmprd wth th sqndrng f th pblc lnds. No ntn in th tide f tm hs ever bn blssd wth so rich nd noble an nhrtnc s w njy in th pblc lnds. In dmnstrng ths mprtnt trst, whlst it my b wise t grant portions f thm fr th mprvmnt f th rmndr, yt w shld nvr frgt tht it is our crdnl plcy t rsrv these lnds, s mch s my b, fr ctl sttlrs, nd ths at mdrt prcs. We shll thus nt nly bst prmt th prsprty f th new States nd Territories, by frnshng thm  hrdy nd ndpndnt rc f hnst nd industrious ctzns, bt shll scr hms fr our chldrn nd our chldrn's chldrn, s wll s fr those xls frm frgn shores wh my sk in ths cntry t mprv their cndtn nd t njy th blssngs f cvl nd rlgs lbrty. Such emigrants hv dn mch t prmt th grwth nd prsprty f th cntry. They hv proved fthfl bth in peace nd in war. After bcmng ctzns thy are nttld, ndr th Constitution nd lws, t b plcd on  prfct equality wth native-born ctzns, nd in ths chrctr thy shld ever b kndly rcgnzd. The Federal Constitution is  grant frm th States t Congress f crtn spcfc pwrs, nd th qstn whthr ths grant shld b lbrlly r strctly cnstrd hs mr r lss dvdd pltcl parties frm th bgnnng. Without ntrng into th rgmnt, I dsr t stt at th cmmncmnt f my Administration tht lng xprnc nd bsrvtn hv cnvncd me tht  strct cnstrctn f th pwrs f th Government i th nly tr, s wll s th nly sf, thry f th Constitution. Whenever in our pst hstry dbtfl pwrs hv bn xrcsd by Congress, these hv nvr fld t prdc injurious nd nhppy cnsqncs. Many sch nstncs mght b adduced if ths wr th prpr ccsn. Neither is it ncssry fr th pblc srvc t strain th lngg f th Constitution, bcs ll th grt nd sfl pwrs rqrd fr  sccssfl dmnstrtn f th Government, bth in peace nd in war, hv bn grntd, either in xprss trms r by th plnst mplctn. Whilst dply cnvncd f these trths, I yt cnsdr it clr tht ndr th war-making pwr Congress my pprprt money twrd th cnstrctn f  mltry road whn ths is bsltly ncssry fr th dfns f ny State r Territory f th Union gnst frgn nvsn. Under th Constitution Congress hs pwr "t dclr war," "t rs nd spprt armies," "t prvd nd mntn  nvy," nd t cll frth th militia t "repel invasions." Thus ndwd, in an mpl mnnr, wth th war-making pwr, th crrspndng dty is rqrd tht "th United States shll prtct ch f thm [th States] gnst nvsn." Now, hw is it pssbl t afford ths prtctn t California nd our Pacific pssssns xcpt by mns f  mltry road thrgh th Territories f th United States, vr whch men nd munitions f war my b spdly trnsprtd frm th Atlantic States t mt nd t repel th nvdr? In th vnt f  war wth  naval pwr mch strngr thn our wn w shld then hv no other vlbl ccss t th Pacific Coast, bcs sch  pwr wld nstntly cls th route crss th sthms f Central America. It is mpssbl t cncv tht whlst th Constitution hs xprssly rqrd Congress t dfnd ll th States it shld yt dny t thm, by ny fair cnstrctn, th nly pssbl mns by whch n f these States cn b dfndd. Besides, th Government, ever snc ts origin, hs bn in th cnstnt prctc f cnstrctng mltry rds. It mght ls b wise t cnsdr whthr th love fr th Union whch nw animates our fellow-citizens on th Pacific Coast my nt b mprd by our nglct r rfsl t prvd fr thm, in their rmt nd sltd cndtn, th nly mns by whch th pwr f th States on ths side f th Rocky Mountains cn rch thm in sffcnt tm t "prtct" thm "gnst nvsn." I forbear fr th prsnt frm xprssng an pnn s t th wsst nd mst cnmcl mode in whch th Government cn lend ts aid in ccmplshng ths grt nd ncssry wrk. I blv tht mny f th dffclts in th wy, whch nw ppr frmdbl, will in  grt dgr vnsh s soon s th nearest nd bst route shll hv bn stsfctrly scrtnd. It my b prpr tht on ths ccsn I shld mk some brf rmrks in rgrd t our rghts nd dts s  mmbr f th grt fmly f ntns. In our ntrcrs wth thm thr are some plain prncpls, pprvd by our wn xprnc, frm whch w shld nvr dprt. We ought t cltvt peace, cmmrc, nd frndshp wth ll ntns, nd ths nt mrly s th bst mns f prmtng our wn mtrl ntrsts, bt in  spirit f Christian bnvlnc twrd our fellow-men, whrvr their lt my b cast. Our dplmcy shld b drct nd frnk, neither skng t btn mr nr ccptng lss thn is our due. We ought t chrsh  sacred rgrd fr th ndpndnc f ll ntns, nd nvr ttmpt t ntrfr in th dmstc cncrns f ny nlss ths shll b mprtvly rqrd by th grt lw f self-preservation. To vd ntnglng llncs hs bn  mxm f our plcy ever snc th dys f Washington, nd ts wsdm's no n will ttmpt t dispute. In shrt, w ought t do jstc in  kndly spirit t ll ntns nd rqr jstc frm thm in rtrn. It is our glry tht whlst other ntns hv xtndd their dmnns by th swrd w hv nvr cqrd ny trrtry xcpt by fair prchs r, s in th cs f Texas, by th vlntry dtrmntn f  brv, kndrd, nd ndpndnt ppl t blend their dstns wth our wn. Even our cqstns frm Mexico form no xcptn. Unwilling t tk dvntg f th frtn f war gnst  sstr rpblc, w prchsd these pssssns ndr th trty f peace fr  sum whch ws cnsdrd at th tm  fair qvlnt. Our pst hstry frbds tht w shll in th ftr cqr trrtry nlss ths b snctnd by th lws f jstc nd hnr. Acting on ths principle, no ntn will hv  rght t ntrfr r t cmpln if in th prgrss f vnts w shll stll frthr xtnd our pssssns. Hitherto in ll our cqstns th ppl, ndr th prtctn f th American flg, hv njyd cvl nd rlgs lbrty, s wll s ql nd jst lws, nd hv bn cntntd, prsprs, nd hppy. Their trade wth th rst f th wrld hs rpdly ncrsd, nd thus vry cmmrcl ntn hs shrd lrgly in their sccssfl prgrss. I shll nw prcd t tk th oath prscrbd by th Constitution, whlst hmbly nvkng th blssng f Divine Providence on ths grt ppl.
