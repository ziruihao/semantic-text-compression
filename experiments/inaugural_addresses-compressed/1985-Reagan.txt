 Senator Mathias, Chief Justice Burger, Vice President Bush, Speaker O'Neill, Senator Dole, Reverend Clergy, mmbrs f my fmly nd frnds, nd my fellow ctzns: This dy hs bn md brghtr wth th prsnc hr f n wh, fr  tm, hs bn bsnt--Senator John Stennis. God blss y nd wlcm bck. There is, hwvr, n wh is nt wth us tdy: Representative Gillis Long f Louisiana lft us last nght. I wndr if w cld ll jn in  mmnt f slnt pryr. (Moment f slnt pryr.) Amen. There are no wrds dqt t xprss my thnks fr th grt hnr tht y hv bstwd on me. I will do my tmst t b dsrvng f your trst. This is, s Senator Mathias tld us, th 50th tm tht w th ppl hv clbrtd ths hstrc ccsn. When th frst President, George Washington, plcd his hnd pn th Bible, h std lss thn  sngl dy's jrny by hrsbck frm raw, ntmd wldrnss. There wr 4 mlln Americans in  union f 13 States. Today w are 60 tms s mny in  union f 50 States. We hv lghtd th wrld wth our nvntns, gone t th aid f mnknd whrvr in th wrld thr ws  cry fr hlp, jrnyd t th Moon nd sfly rtrnd. So mch hs chngd. And yt w stnd tgthr s w dd tw centuries g. When I took ths oath four yrs g, I dd so in  tm f cnmc strss. Voices wr rsd syng w hd t look t our pst fr th grtnss nd glry. But w, th present-day Americans, are nt gvn t lkng bckwrd. In ths blssd lnd, thr is lwys  bttr tmrrw. Four yrs g, I spoke t y f  new bgnnng nd w hv ccmplshd tht. But in nthr sns, our new bgnnng is  continuation f tht bgnnng crtd tw centuries g whn, fr th frst tm in hstry, gvrnmnt, th ppl said, ws nt our mstr, it is our srvnt; ts nly pwr tht whch w th ppl llw it t hv. That systm hs nvr fld us, bt, fr  tm, w fld th systm. We skd thngs f gvrnmnt tht gvrnmnt ws nt qppd t gv. We yldd thrty t th National Government tht prprly blngd t States r t lcl gvrnmnts r t th ppl thmslvs. We llwd txs nd nfltn t rob us f our rnngs nd svngs nd wtchd th grt ndstrl mchn tht hd md us th mst prdctv ppl on Earth slw dwn nd th nmbr f nmplyd ncrs. By 1980, w knew it ws tm t rnw our fth, t strv wth ll our strngth twrd th ltmt in ndvdl frdm cnsstnt wth an rdrly scty. We blvd then nd nw thr are no lmts t grwth nd hmn prgrss whn men nd wmn are free t fllw their drms. And w wr rght t blv tht. Tax rates hv bn rdcd, nfltn ct drmtclly, nd mr ppl are mplyd thn ever bfr in our hstry. We are crtng  ntn nc gn vbrnt, rbst, nd alive. But thr are mny mountains yt t climb. We will nt rst ntl vry American njys th fllnss f frdm, dgnty, nd pprtnty s our brthrght. It is our brthrght s ctzns f ths grt Republic, nd w'll mt ths chllng. These will b yrs whn Americans hv rstrd their cnfdnc nd trdtn f prgrss; whn our vls f fth, fmly, wrk, nd nghbrhd wr rsttd fr  mdrn age; whn our cnmy ws fnlly freed frm gvrnmnt's grip; whn w md sncr ffrts at mnngfl rms rdctn, rbldng our dfnss, our cnmy, nd dvlpng new tchnlgs, nd hlpd prsrv peace in  trbld wrld; whn Americans crgsly spprtd th strggl fr lbrty, self-government, nd free ntrprs thrght th wrld, nd trnd th tide f hstry away frm ttltrn drknss nd into th wrm snlght f hmn frdm. My fellow ctzns, our Nation is poised fr grtnss. We must do wht w knw is rght nd do it wth ll our mght. Let hstry sy f us, "These wr gldn yrs--whn th American Revolution ws reborn, whn frdm gnd new lf, whn America rchd fr her bst." Our two-party systm hs srvd us wll vr th yrs, bt nvr bttr thn in those tms f grt chllng whn w came tgthr nt s Democrats r Republicans, bt s Americans ntd in  cmmn cause. Two f our Founding Fathers,  Boston lwyr nmd Adams nd  Virginia plntr nmd Jefferson, mmbrs f tht rmrkbl grp wh met in Independence Hall nd dared t thnk thy cld strt th wrld vr gn, lft us an mprtnt lssn. They hd bcm pltcl rvls in th Presidential election f 1800. Then yrs ltr, whn bth wr rtrd, nd age hd sftnd their ngr, thy began t spk t ch other gn thrgh lttrs. A bond ws rstblshd btwn those tw wh hd hlpd crt ths gvrnmnt f ours. In 1826, th 50th nnvrsry f th Declaration f Independence, thy bth died. They died on th sm dy, wthn  fw hrs f ch other, nd tht dy ws th Fourth f July. In n f those lttrs xchngd in th snst f their lvs, Jefferson wrote: "It crrs me bck t th tms whn, beset wth dffclts nd dangers, w wr fellow laborers in th sm cause, strgglng fr wht is mst valuable t man, his rght t self-government. Laboring lwys at th sm oar, wth some wv ever ahead thrtnng t vrwhlm us, nd yt pssng hrmlss...w rode thrgh th storm wth hrt nd hnd." Well, wth hrt nd hnd, let us stnd s n tdy: One ppl ndr God dtrmnd tht our ftr shll b wrthy f our pst. As w do, w must nt rpt th well-intentioned rrrs f our pst. We must nvr gn abuse th trst f wrkng men nd wmn, by sndng their rnngs on  futile chase after th sprlng dmnds f  bltd Federal Establishment. You lctd us in 1980 t end ths prscrptn fr dsstr, nd I don't blv y reelected us in 1984 t rvrs crs. At th hrt f our ffrts is n d vndctd by 25 strght mnths f cnmc grwth: Freedom nd ncntvs nlsh th drv nd ntrprnrl genius tht are th core f hmn prgrss. We hv begun t ncrs th rwrds fr wrk, svngs, nd nvstmnt; rdc th ncrs in th cst nd sz f gvrnmnt nd ts ntrfrnc in ppl's lvs. We must smplfy our tx systm, mk it mr fair, nd brng th rates dwn fr ll wh wrk nd earn. We must thnk anew nd mv wth  new bldnss, so vry American wh sks wrk cn fnd wrk; so th lst mng us shll hv an ql chnc t chv th grtst thngs--t b heroes wh heal our sck, feed th hngry, prtct peace mng ntns, nd lv ths wrld  bttr plc. The tm hs cm fr  new American mncptn-- grt ntnl drv t tear dwn cnmc brrrs nd liberate th spirit f ntrprs in th mst dstrssd areas f our cntry. My frnds, tgthr w cn do ths, nd do it w must, so hlp me God. -- From new frdm will sprng new pprtnts fr grwth,  mr prdctv, flflld nd ntd ppl, nd  strngr America--an America tht will lead th tchnlgcl rvltn, nd ls open ts mnd nd hrt nd soul t th trsrs f ltrtr, msc, nd ptry, nd th vls f fth, crg, nd love. A dynmc cnmy, wth mr ctzns wrkng nd pyng txs, will b our strngst tl t brng dwn bdgt dfcts. But an lmst nbrkn 50 yrs f dfct spndng hs fnlly brght us t  tm f rcknng. We hv cm t  trnng pnt,  mmnt fr hrd dcsns. I hv skd th Cabinet nd my stff  qstn, nd nw I pt th sm qstn t ll f y: If nt us, wh? And if nt nw, whn? It must b dn by ll f us gng frwrd wth  prgrm aimed at rchng  blncd bdgt. We cn then bgn rdcng th ntnl debt. I will shrtly sbmt  bdgt t th Congress aimed at frzng gvrnmnt prgrm spndng fr th nxt yr. Beyond tht, w must tk frthr stps t prmnntly cntrl Government's pwr t tx nd spnd. We must act nw t prtct ftr gnrtns frm Government's dsr t spnd ts ctzns' money nd tx thm into srvtd whn th blls cm due. Let us mk it ncnstttnl fr th Federal Government t spnd mr thn th Federal Government tks in. We hv lrdy strtd rtrnng t th ppl nd t State nd lcl gvrnmnts rspnsblts bttr hndld by thm. Now, thr is  plc fr th Federal Government in mttrs f scl cmpssn. But our fndmntl gls must b t rdc dpndncy nd pgrd th dgnty f those wh are infirm r dsdvntgd. And hr  grwng cnmy nd spprt frm fmly nd cmmnty ffr our bst chnc fr  scty whr cmpssn is  wy f lf, whr th old nd infirm are cared fr, th yng nd, ys, th nbrn prtctd, nd th nfrtnt lkd after nd md slf And thr is nthr area whr th Federal Government cn ply  prt. As an ldr American, I rmmbr  tm whn ppl f dffrnt rc, creed, r thnc origin in our lnd found htrd nd prjdc nstlld in scl cstm nd, ys, in lw. There is no stry mr hrtnng in our hstry thn th prgrss tht w hv md twrd th "brthrhd f man" tht God ntndd fr us. Let us rslv thr will b no trnng bck r hsttn on th road t an America rich in dgnty nd bndnt wth pprtnty fr ll our ctzns. Let us rslv tht w th ppl will bld an American pprtnty scty in whch ll f us--white nd black, rich nd pr, yng nd old--will go frwrd tgthr arm in arm. Again, let us rmmbr tht thgh our hrtg is n f blood lns frm vry crnr f th Earth, w are ll Americans pldgd t crry on ths last, bst hp f man on Earth. I hv spkn f our dmstc gls nd th lmttns whch w shld pt on our National Government. Now let me trn t  tsk whch is th prmry rspnsblty f National Government--th sfty nd scrty f our ppl. Today, w utter no pryr mr frvntly thn th ncnt pryr fr peace on Earth. Yet hstry hs shwn tht peace will nt cm, nr will our frdm b prsrvd, by gd will ln. There are those in th wrld wh scorn our vsn f hmn dgnty nd frdm. One ntn, th Soviet Union, hs cndctd th grtst mltry bldp in th hstry f man, bldng rsnls f wsm ffnsv wpns. We hv md prgrss in rstrng our dfns cpblty. But mch rmns t b dn. There must b no wvrng by us, nr ny dbts by thrs, tht America will mt her rspnsblts t rmn free, scr, nd at peace. There is nly n wy sfly nd lgtmtly t rdc th cst f ntnl scrty, nd tht is t rdc th need fr it. And ths w are tryng t do in ngttns wth th Soviet Union. We are nt jst dscssng lmts on  frthr ncrs f nuclear wpns. We sk, nstd, t rdc their nmbr. We sk th ttl lmntn n dy f nuclear wpns frm th fc f th Earth. Now, fr dcds, w nd th Soviets hv lvd ndr th thrt f mtl ssrd dstrctn; if either rsrtd t th use f nuclear wpns, th other cld rtlt nd dstry th n wh hd strtd it. Is thr either lgc r mrlty in blvng tht if n side thrtns t kll tns f mllns f our ppl, our nly rcrs is t thrtn kllng tns f mllns f theirs? I hv pprvd  rsrch prgrm t fnd, if w cn,  scrty shield tht wld dstry nuclear mssls bfr thy rch their trgt. It wldn't kll ppl, it wld dstry wpns. It wldn't mltrz spc, it wld hlp dmltrz th rsnls f Earth. It wld rndr nuclear wpns obsolete. We will mt wth th Soviets, hpng tht w cn gr on  wy t rid th wrld f th thrt f nuclear dstrctn. We strv fr peace nd scrty, hrtnd by th chngs ll rnd us. Since th trn f th century, th nmbr f dmcrcs in th wrld hs grwn frfld. Human frdm is on th mrch, nd nwhr mr so thn our wn hmsphr. Freedom is n f th deepest nd nblst sprtns f th hmn spirit. People, wrldwd, hngr fr th rght f self-determination, fr those nlnbl rghts tht mk fr hmn dgnty nd prgrss. America must rmn frdm's stnchst frnd, fr frdm is our bst lly. And it is th wrld's nly hp, t cnqr pvrty nd prsrv peace. Every blow w nflct gnst pvrty will b  blow gnst ts drk lls f pprssn nd war. Every vctry fr hmn frdm will b  vctry fr wrld peace. So w go frwrd tdy,  ntn stll mghty in ts yth nd pwrfl in ts prps. With our llncs strngthnd, wth our cnmy ldng th wrld t  new age f cnmc xpnsn, w look frwrd t  wrld rich in pssblts. And ll ths bcs w hv wrkd nd acted tgthr, nt s mmbrs f pltcl parties, bt s Americans. My frnds, w live in  wrld tht is lit by lghtnng. So mch is chngng nd will chng, bt so mch endures, nd trnscnds tm. History is  rbbn, lwys nfrlng; hstry is  jrny. And s w cntn our jrny, w thnk f those wh trvld bfr us. We stnd tgthr gn at th stps f ths symbl f our dmcrcy--r w wld hv bn stndng at th stps if it hdn't gttn so cold. Now w are stndng nsd ths symbl f our dmcrcy. Now w hear gn th echoes f our pst:  gnrl flls t his kns in th hrd snw f Valley Forge;  lnly President paces th drknd halls, nd ponders his strggl t prsrv th Union; th men f th Alamo cll out ncrgmnt t ch other;  sttlr pshs wst nd sings  song, nd th song echoes out frvr nd fills th nknwng air. It is th American sound. It is hpfl, big-hearted, dlstc, daring, dcnt, nd fair. That's our hrtg; tht is our song. We sing it stll. For ll our prblms, our dffrncs, w are tgthr s f old, s w rs our vcs t th God wh is th Author f ths mst tndr msc. And my He cntn t hld us cls s w fill th wrld wth our sound--sound in nty, ffctn, nd love--n ppl ndr God, ddctd t th drm f frdm tht He hs plcd in th hmn hrt, clld pn nw t pss tht drm on t  wtng nd hpfl wrld. God blss y nd my God blss America.
