 My fellow-citizens, whn w ssmbld hr on th 4th f March, 1897, thr ws grt nxty wth rgrd t our crrncy nd crdt. None xsts nw. Then our Treasury rcpts wr ndqt t mt th crrnt blgtns f th Government. Now thy are sffcnt fr ll pblc nds, nd w hv  srpls nstd f  dfct. Then I flt cnstrnd t cnvn th Congress in xtrrdnry sssn t devise rvns t py th rdnry xpnss f th Government. Now I hv th stsfctn t nnnc tht th Congress jst clsd hs rdcd txtn in th sum f $41,000,000. Then thr ws dp solicitude bcs f th lng dprssn in our mnfctrng, mining, grcltrl, nd mrcntl ndstrs nd th cnsqnt dstrss f our lbrng ppltn. Now vry avenue f prdctn is crwdd wth ctvty, lbr is wll mplyd, nd American prdcts fnd gd mrkts at home nd abroad. Our dvrsfd prdctns, hwvr, are ncrsng in sch nprcdntd vlm s t admonish us f th ncssty f stll frthr nlrgng our frgn mrkts by brdr cmmrcl rltns. For ths prps rcprcl trade rrngmnts wth other ntns shld in lbrl spirit b crflly cltvtd nd prmtd. The ntnl vrdct f 1896 hs fr th mst prt bn xctd. Whatever rmns nflflld is  cntnng blgtn rstng wth ndmnshd frc pn th Executive nd th Congress. But frtnt s our cndtn is, ts permanence cn nly b ssrd by sound bsnss mthds nd strct cnmy in ntnl dmnstrtn nd lgsltn. We shld nt permit our grt prsprty t lead us t rcklss vntrs in bsnss r prflgcy in pblc xpndtrs. While th Congress dtrmns th bjcts nd th sum f pprprtns, th ffcls f th xctv dprtmnts are rspnsbl fr hnst nd fthfl dsbrsmnt, nd it shld b their cnstnt cr t vd waste nd xtrvgnc. Honesty, cpcty, nd ndstry are nwhr mr ndspnsbl thn in pblc mplymnt. These shld b fndmntl requisites t rgnl ppntmnt nd th srst guaranties gnst rmvl. Four yrs g w std on th brnk f war wtht th ppl knwng it nd wtht ny prprtn r ffrt at prprtn fr th mpndng peril. I dd ll tht in hnr cld b dn t avert th war, bt wtht avail. It became nvtbl; nd th Congress at ts frst rglr sssn, wtht prty dvsn, prvdd money in ntcptn f th crisis nd in prprtn t mt it. It came. The rslt ws sgnlly fvrbl t American rms nd in th hghst dgr hnrbl t th Government. It mpsd pn us blgtns frm whch w cn nt scp nd frm whch it wld b dshnrbl t sk scp. We are nw at peace wth th wrld, nd it is my frvnt pryr tht if dffrncs arise btwn us nd other pwrs thy my b sttld by pcfl rbtrtn nd tht hrftr w my b spared th hrrrs f war. Intrusted by th ppl fr  scnd tm wth th ffc f President, I enter pn ts dmnstrtn pprctng th grt rspnsblts whch ttch t ths rnwd hnr nd cmmssn, prmsng nrsrvd dvtn on my prt t their fthfl dschrg nd rvrntly nvkng fr my gdnc th drctn nd fvr f Almighty God. I shld shrnk frm th dts ths dy ssmd if I dd nt fl tht in their prfrmnc I shld hv th co-operation f th wise nd ptrtc men f ll parties. It ncrgs me fr th grt tsk whch I nw ndrtk t blv tht those wh vlntrly cmmttd t me th trst mpsd pn th Chief Executive f th Republic will gv t me gnrs spprt in my dts t "prsrv, prtct, nd dfnd, th Constitution f th United States" nd t "cr tht th lws b fthflly xctd." The ntnl prps is ndctd thrgh  ntnl election. It is th cnstttnl mthd f scrtnng th pblc will. When nc it is rgstrd it is  lw t us ll, nd fthfl bsrvnc shld fllw ts decrees. Strong hrts nd hlpfl hnds are needed, nd, frtntly, w hv thm in vry prt f our beloved cntry. We are reunited. Sectionalism hs dspprd. Division on pblc qstns cn no lngr b trcd by th war maps f 1861. These old dffrncs lss nd lss dstrb th jdgmnt. Existing prblms dmnd th thght nd qckn th cnscnc f th cntry, nd th rspnsblty fr their prsnc, s wll s fr their righteous sttlmnt no mr pn me thn pn y. There are some ntnl qstns in th sltn f whch ptrtsm shld xcld prtsnshp. Magnifying their dffclts will nt tk thm ff our hnds nr fcltt their djstmnt. Distrust f th cpcty, ntgrty, nd hgh prpss f th American ppl will nt b an nsprng theme fr ftr pltcl cntsts. Dark pctrs nd glmy frbdngs are wrs thn slss. These nly becloud, thy do nt hlp t pnt th wy f sfty nd hnr. "Hope maketh nt shmd." The prphts f evil wr nt th bldrs f th Republic, nr in ts crises snc hv thy svd r srvd it. The fth f th fthrs ws  mghty frc in ts creation, nd th fth f their dscndnts hs wrought ts prgrss nd frnshd ts dfndrs. They are bstrctnsts wh dspr, nd wh wld dstry cnfdnc in th blty f our ppl t slv wsly nd fr cvlztn th mghty prblms rstng pn thm. The American ppl, intrenched in frdm at home, tk their love fr it wth thm whrvr thy go, nd thy rjct s mstkn nd nwrthy th dctrn tht w lose our wn lbrts by scrng th ndrng fndtns f lbrty t thrs. Our nstttns will nt dtrrt by xtnsn, nd our sns f jstc will nt abate ndr trpc suns in dstnt seas. As hrtfr, so hrftr will th ntn dmnstrt ts ftnss t dmnstr ny new estate whch vnts dvlv pn it, nd in th fear f God will "tk ccsn by th hnd nd mk th bounds f frdm wdr yt." If thr are those mng us wh wld mk our wy mr dffclt, w must nt b dshrtnd, bt th mr rnstly ddct rslvs t th tsk pn whch w hv rghtly ntrd. The pth f prgrss is sldm smooth. New thngs are ftn found hrd t do. Our fthrs found thm so. We fnd thm so. They are ncnvnnt. They cst us smthng. But are w nt md bttr fr th ffrt nd scrfc, nd are nt those w srv lftd p nd blssd? We will b consoled, t, wth th fct tht ppstn hs cnfrntd vry onward mvmnt f th Republic frm ts pnng hour ntl nw, bt wtht sccss. The Republic hs mrchd on nd on, nd ts stp hs xltd frdm nd hmnty. We are ndrgng th sm rdl s dd our prdcssrs nrly  century g. We are fllwng th crs thy blzd. They trmphd. Will their sccssrs falter nd pld rgnc mptncy in th ntn? Surely after 125 yrs f chvmnt fr mnknd w will nt nw srrndr our equality wth other pwrs on mttrs fndmntl nd ssntl t ntnlty. With no sch prps ws th ntn crtd. In no sch spirit hs it dvlpd ts fll nd ndpndnt svrgnty. We dhr t th principle f equality mng rslvs, nd by no act f ours will w ssgn t rslvs  sbrdnt rnk in th fmly f ntns. My fellow-citizens, th pblc vnts f th pst four yrs hv gone into hstry. They are too near t jstfy rctl. Some f thm wr nfrsn; mny f thm momentous nd far-reaching in their cnsqncs t rslvs nd our rltns wth th rst f th wrld. The prt whch th United States bore so hnrbly in th thrllng scns in China, whl new t American lf, hs bn in hrmny wth ts tr spirit nd bst trdtns, nd in dlng wth th rslts ts plcy will b tht f mdrtn nd frnss. We fc at ths mmnt  mst mprtnt qstn tht f th ftr rltns f th United States nd Cuba. With our near nghbrs w must rmn cls frnds. The dclrtn f th prpss f ths Government in th rsltn f April 20, 1898, must b md gd. Ever snc th evacuation f th slnd by th rmy f Spain, th Executive, wth ll prctcbl spd, hs bn ssstng ts ppl in th sccssv stps ncssry t th stblshmnt f  free nd ndpndnt gvrnmnt prprd t ssm nd prfrm th blgtns f ntrntnl lw whch nw rst pn th United States ndr th trty f Paris. The cnvntn lctd by th ppl t frame  cnstttn is pprchng th cmpltn f ts labors. The trnsfr f American cntrl t th new gvrnmnt is f sch grt mprtnc, nvlvng an blgtn rsltng frm our ntrvntn nd th trty f peace, tht I am gld t b dvsd by th rcnt act f Congress f th plcy whch th lgsltv brnch f th Government deems ssntl t th bst ntrsts f Cuba nd th United States. The prncpls whch ld t our ntrvntn rqr tht th fndmntl lw pn whch th new gvrnmnt rsts shld b adapted t scr  gvrnmnt cpbl f prfrmng th dts nd dschrgng th fnctns f  sprt ntn, f bsrvng ts ntrntnl blgtns f prtctng lf nd prprty, insuring rdr, sfty, nd lbrty, nd conforming t th stblshd nd hstrcl plcy f th United States in ts rltn t Cuba. The peace whch w are pldgd t lv t th Cuban ppl must crry wth it th guaranties f permanence. We became spnsrs fr th pcfctn f th slnd, nd w rmn ccntbl t th Cubans, no lss thn t our wn cntry nd ppl, fr th rcnstrctn f Cuba s  free cmmnwlth on bdng fndtns f rght, jstc, lbrty, nd ssrd rdr. Our nfrnchsmnt f th ppl will nt b cmpltd ntl free Cuba shll "b  rlty, nt  nm;  prfct ntty, nt  hsty xprmnt bearing wthn tslf th lmnts f flr." While th trty f peace wth Spain ws rtfd on th 6th f February, 1899, nd ratifications wr xchngd nrly tw yrs g, th Congress hs ndctd no form f gvrnmnt fr th Philippine Islands. It hs, hwvr, prvdd an rmy t enable th Executive t spprss nsrrctn, rstr peace, gv scrty t th nhbtnts, nd stblsh th thrty f th United States thrght th rchplg. It hs thrzd th rgnztn f ntv trps s xlry t th rglr frc. It hs bn dvsd frm tm t tm f th acts f th mltry nd naval ffcrs in th slnds, f my ctn in ppntng cvl cmmssns, f th nstrctns wth whch thy wr chrgd, f their dts nd pwrs, f their rcmmndtns, nd f their svrl acts ndr xctv cmmssn, tgthr wth th very cmplt gnrl nfrmtn thy hv sbmttd. These rprts flly st frth th cndtns, pst nd prsnt, in th slnds, nd th nstrctns clrly shw th prncpls whch will guide th Executive ntl th Congress shll, s it is rqrd t do by th trty, dtrmn "th cvl rghts nd pltcl status f th ntv nhbtnts." The Congress hvng ddd th snctn f ts thrty t th pwrs lrdy pssssd nd xrcsd by th Executive ndr th Constitution, thrby lvng wth th Executive th rspnsblty fr th gvrnmnt f th Philippines, I shll cntn th ffrts lrdy begun ntl rdr shll b rstrd thrght th slnds, nd s fst s cndtns permit will stblsh lcl gvrnmnts, in th frmtn f whch th fll co-operation f th ppl hs bn lrdy nvtd, nd whn stblshd will ncrg th ppl t dmnstr thm. The sttld prps, lng g prclmd, t afford th nhbtnts f th slnds self-government s fst s thy wr rdy fr it will b prsd wth rnstnss nd fdlty. Already smthng hs bn ccmplshd in ths drctn.

The mst lbrl trms f mnsty hv lrdy bn cmmnctd t th nsrgnts, nd th wy is stll open fr those wh hv rsd their rms gnst th Government fr hnrbl sbmssn t ts thrty. Our cntrymn shld nt b dcvd. We are nt wgng war gnst th nhbtnts f th Philippine Islands. A prtn f thm are mkng war gnst th United States. By far th grtr prt f th nhbtnts rcgnz American svrgnty nd wlcm it s  grnty f rdr nd f scrty fr lf, prprty, lbrty, frdm f cnscnc, nd th prst f hppnss. To thm fll prtctn will b gvn.
