 Chief Justice Roberts, Vice President Harris, Speaker Pelosi, Leader Schumer, Leader McConnell, Vice President Pence, nd my dstngshd gsts, nd my fellow Americans: This is America's dy. This is dmcrcy's dy,  dy f hstry nd hp, f rnwl nd rslv. Through  crcbl fr th ages America hs bn tstd anew, nd America hs risen t th chllng. Today w clbrt th trmph nt f  cnddt, bt f  cause, th cause f dmcrcy. The people—the will f th ppl hs bn heard, nd th will f th ppl hs bn heeded. We've lrnd gn tht dmcrcy is precious, dmcrcy is frgl. And at ths hour, my frnds, dmcrcy hs prvld. So nw, on ths hllwd grnd whr jst  fw dys g vlnc sght t shk th Capitol's very fndtn, w cm tgthr s n Nation ndr God, ndvsbl, t crry out th pcfl trnsfr f pwr s w hv fr mr thn tw centuries. As w look ahead in our nqly American way—restless, bold, optimistic—and st our sghts on th Nation w knw w cn b nd w must b, I thank my prdcssrs f bth parties fr their prsnc hr tdy. I thank thm frm th bttm f my hrt. And I knw th rslnc f our Constitution nd th strngth, th strngth f our Nation, s ds President Carter, wh I spoke wth last nght, wh cn nt b wth us tdy, bt whm w salute fr his lftm f srvc. I hv jst tkn th sacred oath ch f these ptrts hv tkn, th oath frst swrn by George Washington. But th American stry dpnds nt on ny n f us, nt on some f us, bt on ll f us, on "We th People," wh sk  mr prfct Union. This is  grt Nation; w are gd ppl. Over th centuries, thrgh storm nd strf, in peace nd in war, w've cm so far. But w stll hv far t go. We'll prss frwrd wth spd nd rgncy, fr w hv mch t do in ths wntr f peril nd sgnfcnt pssblts: mch t rpr, mch t rstr, mch t heal, mch t bld, nd mch t gain. Few ppl in our Nation's hstry hv bn mr chllngd r found  tm mr chllngng r dffclt thn th tm w're in nw. A once-in-a-century virus tht slntly stlks th cntry hs tkn s mny lvs in n yr s America lost in ll f World War II. Millions f jbs hv bn lost; hndrds f thsnds f bsnsss clsd. A cry fr rcl jstc some 400 yrs in th mkng mvs us. The drm f jstc fr ll will b dfrrd no lngr. A cry fr srvvl cms frm th planet tslf,  cry tht cn't b ny mr dsprt r ny mr clr. And nw,  rise f pltcl xtrmsm, White sprmcy, dmstc trrrsm tht w must cnfrnt nd w will dft. To vrcm these challenges—to rstr th soul nd scr th ftr f America—requires so mch mr thn wrds. It rqrs th mst lsv f ll thngs in  dmcrcy: nty. Unity. In nthr January on New Year's Day in 1863, Abraham Lincoln sgnd th Emancipation Proclamation. When h pt pen t paper, th President said, nd I quote, "If my nm ever gs dwn into hstry it will b fr ths act, nd my whole soul is in it." My whole soul is in it. Today, on ths January dy, my whole soul is in ths: brngng America tgthr, uniting our ppl, uniting our Nation. And I ask vry American t jn me in ths cause: uniting t fght th foes w fc: ngr, rsntmnt, nd htrd; xtrmsm, lwlssnss, vlnc; dss, jblssnss, nd hplssnss. With nty w cn do grt thngs, mprtnt thngs. We cn rght wrngs. We cn pt ppl t wrk in gd jbs. We cn teach our chldrn in sf schls. We cn vrcm th ddly virus. We cn rwrd wrk nd rbld th mddl clss nd mk hlth cr scr fr ll. We cn dlvr rcl jstc, nd w cn mk America, nc gn, th ldng frc fr gd in th wrld. I knw spkng f nty cn sound t some lk  foolish fntsy these dys. I knw th frcs tht dvd us are dp nd thy are rl. But I ls knw thy are nt new. Our hstry hs bn  cnstnt strggl btwn th American ideal tht w ll are crtd ql nd th hrsh, gly rlty tht rcsm, ntvsm, fear, dmnztn hv lng torn us apart. The bttl is prnnl. And vctry is nvr ssrd. Through th Civil War, th Great Depression, World War, 9/11, thrgh strggl, scrfc, nd stbcks, our "bttr angels" hv lwys prvld. In ch f these mmnts, ngh f us—enough f us—have cm tgthr t crry ll f us frwrd. And w cn do tht nw. History, fth, nd rsn shw th wy: th wy f nty. We cn see ch other nt s dvrsrs, bt s nghbrs. We cn trt ch other wth dgnty nd rspct. We cn jn frcs, stop th shouting, nd lwr th tmprtr. For wtht nty, thr is no peace, nly bttrnss nd fury. No prgrss, nly xhstng trg. No ntn, nly  stt f chaos. This is our hstrc mmnt f crisis nd chllng, nd nty is th pth frwrd. And w must mt ths mmnt s th United States f America. If w do tht, I grnt y, w will nt fail. We hv nvr, ever, ever, ever fld in America whn w hv acted tgthr. And so tdy, at ths tm, in ths plc, let's strt afresh, ll f us. Let's bgn t lstn t n nthr, hear n nthr, see n nthr, shw rspct t n nthr. Politics dsn't hv t b  raging fire dstryng vrythng in ts pth. Every dsgrmnt dsn't hv t b  cause fr ttl war. And w must rjct th cltr in whch fcts thmslvs are mnpltd nd vn mnfctrd. My fellow Americans, w hv t b dffrnt thn ths. America hs t b bttr thn ths. And I blv America is so mch bttr thn ths. Just look rnd. Here w stnd, in th shdw f th Capitol dome, s ws mentioned rlr, cmpltd amid th Civil War, whn th Union tslf ws ltrlly hngng in th blnc. Yet w ndrd, w prvld. Here w stnd lkng out on th grt Mall whr Dr. King spoke f his drm. Here w stnd, whr 108 yrs g, at nthr Inaugural, thsnds f prtstrs trd t blck brv wmn mrchng fr th rght t vt. And tdy w mrk th swearing-in f th frst woman in American hstry lctd t ntnl ffc: Vice President Kamala Harris. Don't tll me thngs cn't chng. Here w stnd crss th Potomac frm Arlington Cemetery, whr heroes wh gave th last fll msr f dvtn rst in trnl peace. And hr w stnd, jst dys after  riotous mb thght thy cld use vlnc t slnc th will f th ppl, t stop th wrk f our dmcrcy, t drv us frm ths sacred grnd. It dd nt hppn. It will nvr hppn, nt tdy, nt tmrrw, nt ever—not ever. To ll those wh spprtd our cmpgn, I am hmbld by th fth y've plcd in us. To ll those wh dd nt spprt us, let me sy ths: Hear me out s w mv frwrd. Take  msr f me nd my hrt. And if y stll dsgr, so b it. That's dmcrcy. That's America. The rght t dssnt pcbly, wthn th grdrls f our Republic, is prhps ths Nation's grtst strngth. Yet hear me clrly: Disagreement must nt lead t dsnn. And I pldg ths t y: I will b  President fr ll Americans—all Americans. And I prms y, I will fght s hrd fr those wh dd nt spprt me s fr those wh dd. Many centuries g, Saint Augustine,  saint f my chrch, wrote tht  ppl ws  mlttd defined by th cmmn bjcts f their love—defined by th cmmn bjcts f their love. What are th cmmn bjcts w s Americans love? That dfn us s Americans? I thnk w knw: pprtnty, scrty, lbrty, dgnty, rspct, hnr, nd ys, th trth. Recent wks nd mnths hv taught us  pnfl lssn. There is trth, nd thr are lies: lies tld fr pwr nd fr prft. And ch f us hs  dty nd  rspnsblty, s ctzns, s Americans, nd spclly s leaders—leaders wh hv pldgd t hnr our Constitution nd prtct our Nation—to dfnd th trth nd dft th lies. Look, I ndrstnd tht mny f my fellow Americans vw th ftr wth fear nd trpdtn. I ndrstnd thy wrry about their jbs. I ndrstnd, lk my dad, thy ly at bed at nght staring at th ceiling, wndrng: "Can I kp my hlth cr? Can I py my mrtgg?" Thinking about their fmls, about wht cms nxt. I prms y, I gt it. But th nswr is nt t trn nwrd, t rtrt into cmptng fctns, dstrstng those wh don't look lk y r wrshp th wy y do r don't gt their nws frm th sm srcs y do. We must end ths ncvl war tht pits red gnst blue, rrl versus rbn, cnsrvtv versus lbrl. We cn do ths if w open our souls nstd f hrdnng our hrts, if w shw  lttl tlrnc nd hmlty, nd if w're wllng t stnd in th other prsn's shs, s my mom wld sy, jst fr  mmnt. Stand in their shs. Because hr is th thng about lf: There is no ccntng fr wht fate will dl y. Some dys whn y need  hnd. There are other dys whn w're clld t lend  hnd. That's hw it hs t b. That is wht w do fr n nthr. And if w are ths wy, our cntry will b strngr, mr prsprs, mr rdy fr th ftr. And w cn stll dsgr. My fellow Americans, in th wrk ahead f us, w're gng t need ch other. We need ll our strngth t prsvr thrgh ths drk wntr. We're ntrng wht my b th tghst nd ddlst prd f th virus. We must st aside pltcs nd fnlly fc ths pndmc s n Nation. One Nation. And I prms y ths: As th Bible sys, "Weeping my endure fr  nght, bt jy cmth in th mrnng." We will gt thrgh ths, together—together. Look, flks, ll my cllgs tht I srvd wth in th House nd th Senate p hr. We ll ndrstnd th wrld is wtchng, wtchng ll f us tdy. So hr is my mssg t those bynd our brdrs: America hs bn tstd, nd w hv cm out strngr fr it. We will rpr our llncs nd ngg wth th wrld nc gn, nt t mt ystrdy's chllngs, bt tdy's nd tmrrw's chllngs. And w'll lead nt mrly by th xmpl f our pwr, bt by th pwr f our xmpl. We will b  strng nd trstd prtnr fr peace, prgrss, nd scrty. Look, y ll knw, w hv bn thrgh so mch in ths Nation. And, in my frst act s President, I'd lk t ask y t jn me in  mmnt f slnt pryr t rmmbr ll those w lost ths pst yr t th pndmc, those 400,000 fellow Americans: mms, dads, hsbnds, wives, sons, dghtrs, frnds, nghbrs, nd cwrkrs. We will hnr thm by bcmng th ppl nd Nation w knw w cn nd shld b. So I ask y, let's sy  slnt pryr fr those wh hv lost their lvs, fr those thy lft bhnd, nd fr our cntry. [At ths pnt,  mmnt f slnc ws bsrvd.] Amen. Folks, ths is  tm f tstng. We fc an ttck on our dmcrcy nd on trth,  raging virus, grwng nqty, th sting f systmc rcsm,  clmt in crisis, America's role in th wrld. Any n f these wld b ngh t chllng us in prfnd wys. But th fct is, w fc thm ll at nc, prsntng ths Nation wth n f th grvst f rspnsblts w've hd. Now w're gng t b tstd. Are w gng t stp p? All f us? It is tm fr bldnss, fr thr is so mch t do. And ths is crtn, I prms y: We will b jdgd, y nd I, by hw w rslv these cscdng crises f our era. Will w rise t th ccsn, is th qstn. Will w mstr ths rr nd dffclt hour? Will w mt our blgtns nd pss along  new nd bttr wrld t our chldrn? I blv w must; I'm sr y do s wll. I blv w will. And whn w do, w will wrt th nxt grt chptr in th hstry f th United States f America: th American stry,  stry tht mght sound smthng lk  song tht mns  lt t me. It's clld "American Anthem," nd thr's n verse tht stnds out, at lst fr me, nd it gs lk ths:" The wrk nd pryrs f centuries hv brght us t ths dy What shll b our lgcy? What will our chldrn sy?. . . Let me knw in my hrt whn my dys are thrgh America, America, I gave my bst t y." Let's add—let's us add our wn wrk nd pryrs t th nfldng stry f our grt Nation. If w do ths, then whn our dys are thrgh, our chldrn nd our chldrn's chldrn will sy f us: "They gave their bst. They dd their dty. They healed  brkn lnd." My fellow Americans, I cls tdy whr I began, wth  sacred oath. Before God nd ll f y I gv y my wrd: I will lwys lvl wth y. I will dfnd th Constitution. I will dfnd our dmcrcy. I will dfnd America. And I will gv ll, ll f y, kp vrythng you—I do, in your srvc, thnkng nt f pwr, bt f pssblts; nt f prsnl ntrst, bt f th pblc gd. And tgthr, w shll wrt an American stry f hp, nt fear; f nty, nt dvsn; f lght, nt drknss. A stry f dcncy nd dgnty, love nd hlng, grtnss nd gdnss. May ths b th stry tht guides us, th stry tht nsprs us, nd th stry tht tlls ages yt t cm tht w nswrd th cll f hstry, w met th mmnt; dmcrcy nd hp, trth nd jstc, dd nt die on our wtch, bt thrvd; tht America scrd lbrty at home nd std nc gn s  bcn t th wrld. That is wht w owe our forebearers, n nthr, nd gnrtns t fllw. So wth prps nd rslv w trn t those tsks f our tm, sstnd by fth, drvn by cnvctn, nd dvtd t n nthr nd th cntry w love wth ll our hrts. May God blss America, nd my God prtct our trps. Thank y, America.
