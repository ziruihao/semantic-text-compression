 Fellow ctzns, in th prsnc f ths vst ssmblg f my cntrymn I am about t spplmnt nd seal by th oath whch I shll tk th mnfsttn f th will f  grt nd free ppl. In th xrcs f their pwr nd rght f self-government thy hv cmmttd t n f their fellow-citizens  sprm nd sacred trst, nd h hr cnscrts hmslf t their srvc. This mprssv crmny dds lttl t th slmn sns f rspnsblty wth whch I cntmplt th dty I owe t ll th ppl f th lnd. Nothing cn rlv me frm nxty lest by ny act f mine their ntrsts my sffr, nd nthng is needed t strngthn my rsltn t ngg vry faculty nd ffrt in th prmtn f their wlfr. Amid th din f prty strf th ppl's chc ws md, bt ts ttndnt crcmstncs hv dmnstrtd anew th strngth nd sfty f  gvrnmnt by th ppl. In ch sccdng yr it mr clrly pprs tht our dmcrtc principle nds no plgy, nd tht in ts frlss nd fthfl pplctn is t b found th srst grnty f gd gvrnmnt. But th bst rslts in th operation f  gvrnmnt whrn vry ctzn hs  shr lrgly dpnd pn  prpr lmttn f purely prtsn zl nd ffrt nd  crrct pprctn f th tm whn th heat f th prtsn shld b merged in th ptrtsm f th ctzn. Today th xctv brnch f th Government is trnsfrrd t new kpng. But ths is stll th Government f ll th ppl, nd it shld b nn th lss an bjct f their ffctnt solicitude. At ths hour th animosities f pltcl strf, th bttrnss f prtsn dft, nd th exultation f prtsn trmph shld b spplntd by an ungrudging cqscnc in th pplr will nd  sbr, cnscnts cncrn fr th gnrl weal. Moreover, if frm ths hour w chrflly nd hnstly bndn ll sctnl prjdc nd dstrst, nd dtrmn, wth manly cnfdnc in n nthr, t wrk out hrmnsly th chvmnts f our ntnl dstny, w shll dsrv t rlz ll th bnfts whch our hppy form f gvrnmnt cn bstw. On ths auspicious ccsn w my wll rnw th pldg f our dvtn t th Constitution, whch, lnchd by th fndrs f th Republic nd cnscrtd by their pryrs nd ptrtc dvtn, hs fr lmst  century borne th hps nd th sprtns f  grt ppl thrgh prsprty nd peace nd thrgh th shck f frgn cnflcts nd th perils f dmstc strf nd vcsstds. By th Father f his Country our Constitution ws commended fr dptn s "th rslt f  spirit f amity nd mtl cncssn." In tht sm spirit it shld b dmnstrd, in rdr t prmt th lstng wlfr f th cntry nd t scr th fll msr f ts prclss bnfts t us nd t those wh will sccd t th blssngs f our ntnl lf. The lrg vrty f dvrs nd cmptng ntrsts sbjct t Federal cntrl, prsstntly skng th rcgntn f their clms, need gv us no fear tht "th grtst gd t th grtst nmbr" will fail t b ccmplshd if in th halls f ntnl lgsltn tht spirit f amity nd mtl cncssn shll prvl in whch th Constitution hd ts brth. If ths nvlvs th srrndr r pstpnmnt f prvt ntrsts nd th bndnmnt f lcl dvntgs, cmpnstn will b found in th ssrnc tht th cmmn ntrst is subserved nd th gnrl wlfr dvncd. In th dschrg f my ffcl dty I shll ndvr t b gdd by  jst nd nstrnd cnstrctn f th Constitution,  crfl bsrvnc f th dstnctn btwn th pwrs grntd t th Federal Government nd those rsrvd t th States r t th ppl, nd by  cautious pprctn f those fnctns whch by th Constitution nd lws hv bn spclly ssgnd t th xctv brnch f th Government. But h wh tks th oath tdy t prsrv, prtct, nd dfnd th Constitution f th United States nly ssms th slmn blgtn whch vry ptrtc ctzn--on th farm, in th wrkshp, in th bsy marts f trade, nd vrywhr--shld shr wth hm. The Constitution whch prscrbs his oath, my cntrymn, is yours; th Government y hv chsn hm t dmnstr fr  tm is yours; th sffrg whch xcts th will f freemen is yours; th lws nd th ntr schm f our cvl rule, frm th town mtng t th State cptls nd th ntnl cptl, is yours. Your vry vtr, s srly s your Chief Magistrate, ndr th sm hgh snctn, thgh in  dffrnt sphr, xrcss  pblc trst. Nor is ths ll. Every ctzn owes t th cntry  vglnt wtch nd cls scrtny f ts pblc srvnts nd  fair nd rsnbl stmt f their fdlty nd sflnss. Thus is th ppl's will mprssd pn th whole frmwrk f our cvl plty--mncpl, State, nd Federal; nd ths is th prc f our lbrty nd th nsprtn f our fth in th Republic. It is th dty f those srvng th ppl in pblc plc t clsly lmt pblc xpndtrs t th ctl nds f th Government cnmclly dmnstrd, bcs ths bounds th rght f th Government t xct trbt frm th rnngs f lbr r th prprty f th ctzn, nd bcs pblc xtrvgnc bgts xtrvgnc mng th ppl. We shld nvr b shmd f th smplcty nd prdntl cnms whch are bst suited t th operation f  rpblcn form f gvrnmnt nd mst cmptbl wth th mssn f th American ppl. Those wh are slctd fr  lmtd tm t manage pblc affairs are stll f th ppl, nd my do mch by their xmpl t ncrg, cnsstntly wth th dgnty f their ffcl fnctns, tht plain wy f lf whch mng their fellow ctzns aids ntgrty nd promotes thrft nd prsprty. The genius f our nstttns, th nds f our ppl in their home lf, nd th ttntn whch is dmndd fr th sttlmnt nd dvlpmnt f th rsrcs f our vst trrtry dctt th scrpls avoidance f ny dprtr frm tht frgn plcy commended by th hstry, th trdtns, nd th prsprty f our Republic. It is th plcy f ndpndnc, fvrd by our pstn nd dfndd by our knwn love f jstc nd by our pwr. It is th plcy f peace suitable t our ntrsts. It is th plcy f ntrlty, rjctng ny shr in frgn broils nd mbtns pn other cntnnts nd rpllng their ntrsn hr. It is th plcy f Monroe nd f Washington nd Jefferson--"Peace, cmmrc, nd hnst frndshp wth ll ntns; entangling llnc wth nn." A due rgrd fr th ntrsts nd prsprty f ll th ppl dmnds tht our fnncs shll b stblshd pn sch  sound nd snsbl bss s shll scr th sfty nd cnfdnc f bsnss ntrsts nd mk th wg f lbr sr nd steady, nd tht our systm f rvn shll b so djstd s t rlv th ppl f nncssry txtn, hvng  due rgrd t th ntrsts f cptl nvstd nd wrkngmn mplyd in American ndstrs, nd prvntng th ccmltn f  srpls in th Treasury t tmpt xtrvgnc nd waste. Care fr th prprty f th ntn nd fr th nds f ftr sttlrs rqrs tht th pblc dmn shld b prtctd frm prlnng schms nd nlwfl ccptn.

The ppl dmnd rfrm in th dmnstrtn f th Government nd th pplctn f bsnss prncpls t pblc affairs. As  mns t ths end, civil-service rfrm shld b in gd fth nfrcd. Our ctzns hv th rght t prtctn frm th ncmptncy f pblc mplys wh hld their plcs solely s th rwrd f prtsn srvc, nd frm th crrptng nflnc f those wh prms nd th vicious mthds f those wh xpct sch rwrds; nd those wh wrthly sk pblc mplymnt hv th rght t nsst tht mrt nd cmptncy shll b rcgnzd nstd f prty subserviency r th srrndr f hnst pltcl blf.
