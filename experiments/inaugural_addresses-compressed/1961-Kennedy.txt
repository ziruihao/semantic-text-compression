 Vice President Johnson, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chief Justice, President Eisenhower, Vice President Nixon, President Truman, rvrnd clrgy, fellow ctzns, w bsrv tdy nt  vctry f prty, bt  clbrtn f frdm--symblzng an end, s wll s  bgnnng--sgnfyng rnwl, s wll s chng. For I hv swrn I bfr y nd Almighty God th sm slmn oath our frbrs l prscrbd nrly  century nd three qrtrs g. The wrld is very dffrnt nw. For man hlds in his mortal hnds th pwr t blsh ll frms f hmn pvrty nd ll frms f hmn lf. And yt th sm rvltnry blfs fr whch our frbrs fought are stll at ss rnd th glb--th blf tht th rghts f man cm nt frm th gnrsty f th stt, bt frm th hnd f God. We dare nt frgt tdy tht w are th heirs f tht frst rvltn. Let th wrd go frth frm ths tm nd plc, t frnd nd foe alike, tht th torch hs bn pssd t  new gnrtn f Americans--born in ths century, tmprd by war, dscplnd by  hrd nd bitter peace, proud f our ncnt hrtg--nd nwllng t wtnss r permit th slw undoing f those hmn rghts t whch ths Nation hs lwys bn cmmttd, nd t whch w are cmmttd tdy at home nd rnd th wrld. Let vry ntn knw, whthr it wshs us wll r ill, tht w shll py ny prc, br ny brdn, mt ny hrdshp, spprt ny frnd, pps ny foe, in rdr t ssr th srvvl nd th sccss f lbrty. This mch w pldg--nd mr. To those old lls whs cltrl nd sprtl origins w shr, w pldg th lylty f fthfl frnds. United, thr is lttl w cn nt do in  hst f cprtv vntrs. Divided, thr is lttl w cn do--fr w dare nt mt  pwrfl chllng at odds nd splt asunder. To those new States whm w wlcm t th rnks f th free, w pldg our wrd tht n form f clnl cntrl shll nt hv pssd away mrly t b rplcd by  far mr iron tyrnny. We shll nt lwys xpct t fnd thm spprtng our vw. But w shll lwys hp t fnd thm strngly spprtng their wn frdm--nd t rmmbr tht, in th pst, those wh flshly sght pwr by riding th bck f th tgr ended p nsd. To those peoples in th huts nd vllgs crss th glb strgglng t brk th bnds f mss msry, w pldg our bst ffrts t hlp thm hlp thmslvs, fr whtvr prd is rqrd--nt bcs th Communists my b dng it, nt bcs w sk their vts, bt bcs it is rght. If  free scty cn nt hlp th mny wh are pr, it cn nt sv th fw wh are rich. To our sstr rpblcs sth f our border, w ffr  spcl pldg--t cnvrt our gd wrds into gd deeds--in  new llnc fr prgrss--t ssst free men nd free gvrnmnts in cstng ff th chains f pvrty. But ths pcfl rvltn f hp cn nt bcm th prey f hstl pwrs. Let ll our nghbrs knw tht w shll jn wth thm t pps ggrssn r sbvrsn nywhr in th Americas. And let vry other pwr knw tht ths Hemisphere ntnds t rmn th mstr f ts wn house. To tht wrld ssmbly f svrgn stts, th United Nations, our last bst hp in an age whr th nstrmnts f war hv far tpcd th nstrmnts f peace, w rnw our pldg f spprt--t prvnt it frm bcmng mrly  forum fr nvctv--t strngthn ts shield f th new nd th weak--nd t nlrg th area in whch ts writ my rn. Finally, t those ntns wh wld mk thmslvs our dvrsry, w ffr nt  pldg bt  rqst: tht bth sds bgn anew th qst fr peace, bfr th drk pwrs f dstrctn nlshd by scnc nglf ll hmnty in plnnd r ccdntl self-destruction. We dare nt tmpt thm wth wknss. For nly whn our rms are sffcnt bynd dbt cn w b crtn bynd dbt tht thy will nvr b mplyd. But neither cn tw grt nd pwrfl grps f ntns tk cmfrt frm our prsnt crs--bth sds vrbrdnd by th cst f mdrn wpns, bth rghtly lrmd by th steady sprd f th ddly atom, yt bth rcng t alter tht ncrtn blnc f trrr tht stys th hnd f mnknd's fnl war. So let us bgn anew--rmmbrng on bth sds tht cvlty is nt  sgn f wknss, nd sncrty is lwys sbjct t prf. Let us nvr ngtt out f fear. But let us nvr fear t ngtt. Let bth sds xplr wht prblms unite us nstd f blbrng those prblms whch dvd us. Let bth sds, fr th frst tm, frmlt srs nd precise prpsls fr th nspctn nd cntrl f rms--nd brng th bslt pwr t dstry other ntns ndr th bslt cntrl f ll ntns. Let bth sds sk t nvk th wndrs f scnc nstd f ts terrors. Together let us xplr th stars, cnqr th dsrts, rdct dss, tap th ocean dpths, nd ncrg th arts nd cmmrc. Let bth sds unite t heed in ll crnrs f th rth th cmmnd f Isaiah--t "undo th hvy brdns...nd t let th pprssd go free." And if  bchhd f cprtn my psh bck th jngl f sspcn, let bth sds jn in crtng  new ndvr, nt  new blnc f pwr, bt  new wrld f lw, whr th strng are jst nd th weak scr nd th peace prsrvd. All ths will nt b fnshd in th frst 100 dys. Nor will it b fnshd in th frst 1,000 dys, nr in th lf f ths Administration, nr vn prhps in our lftm on ths planet. But let us bgn. In your hnds, my fellow ctzns, mr thn in mine, will rst th fnl sccss r flr f our crs. Since ths cntry ws fndd, ch gnrtn f Americans hs bn smmnd t gv tstmny t ts ntnl lylty. The grvs f yng Americans wh nswrd th cll t srvc srrnd th glb. Now th trmpt summons us gn--nt s  cll t br rms, thgh rms w need; nt s  cll t bttl, thgh mbttld w are--bt  cll t br th brdn f  lng twlght strggl, yr in nd yr out, "rjcng in hp, ptnt in trbltn"-- strggl gnst th cmmn enemies f man: tyrnny, pvrty, dss, nd war tslf. Can w frg gnst these enemies  grand nd glbl llnc, North nd South, East nd West, tht cn ssr  mr frtfl lf fr ll mnknd? Will y jn in tht hstrc ffrt? In th lng hstry f th wrld, nly  fw gnrtns hv bn grntd th role f dfndng frdm in ts hour f mxmm dngr. I do nt shrnk frm ths rspnsblty--I wlcm it. I do nt blv tht ny f us wld xchng plcs wth ny other ppl r ny other gnrtn. The nrgy, th fth, th dvtn whch w brng t ths ndvr will lght our cntry nd ll wh srv it--nd th glw frm tht fire cn trly lght th wrld. And so, my fellow Americans: ask nt wht your cntry cn do fr y--ask wht y cn do fr your cntry. My fellow ctzns f th wrld: ask nt wht America will do fr y, bt wht tgthr w cn do fr th frdm f man. Finally, whthr y are ctzns f America r ctzns f th wrld, ask f us th sm hgh stndrds f strngth nd scrfc whch w ask f y. With  gd cnscnc our nly sr rwrd, wth hstry th fnl jdg f our deeds, let us go frth t lead th lnd w love, asking His blssng nd His hlp, bt knwng tht hr on rth God's wrk must trly b our wn.
