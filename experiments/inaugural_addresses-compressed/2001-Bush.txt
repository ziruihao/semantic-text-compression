 President Clinton, dstngshd gsts nd my fellow ctzns, th pcfl trnsfr f thrty is rr in hstry, yt cmmn in our cntry. With  smpl oath, w ffrm old trdtns nd mk new bgnnngs. As I bgn, I thank President Clinton fr his srvc t our ntn. And I thank Vice President Gore fr  cntst cndctd wth spirit nd ended wth grace. I am hnrd nd hmbld t stnd hr, whr so mny f America's ldrs hv cm bfr me, nd so mny will fllw. We hv  plc, ll f us, in  lng stry-- stry w cntn, bt whs end w will nt see. It is th stry f  new wrld tht became  frnd nd lbrtr f th old,  stry f  slave-holding scty tht became  srvnt f frdm, th stry f  pwr tht went into th wrld t prtct bt nt pssss, t dfnd bt nt t cnqr. It is th American stry-- stry f flwd nd fllbl ppl, ntd crss th gnrtns by grand nd ndrng ideals. The grndst f these ideals is an nfldng American prms tht vryn blngs, tht vryn dsrvs  chnc, tht no nsgnfcnt prsn ws ever born. Americans are clld t nct ths prms in our lvs nd in our lws. And thgh our ntn hs smtms hltd, nd smtms dlyd, w must fllw no other crs. Through mch f th last century, America's fth in frdm nd dmcrcy ws  rck in  raging sea. Now it is  seed pn th wnd, tkng root in mny ntns. Our dmcrtc fth is mr thn th creed f our cntry, it is th inborn hp f our hmnty, an ideal w crry bt do nt wn,  trst w br nd pss along. And vn after nrly 225 yrs, w hv  lng wy yt t trvl. While mny f our ctzns prspr, thrs dbt th prms, vn th jstc, f our wn cntry. The mbtns f some Americans are lmtd by flng schls nd hddn prjdc nd th crcmstncs f their brth. And smtms our dffrncs rn so dp, it sms w shr  cntnnt, bt nt  cntry. We do nt ccpt ths, nd w will nt llw it. Our nty, our union, is th srs wrk f ldrs nd ctzns in vry gnrtn. And ths is my slmn pldg: I will wrk t bld  sngl ntn f jstc nd pprtnty. I knw ths is in our rch bcs w are gdd by  pwr lrgr thn rslvs wh crts us ql in His mg. And w are cnfdnt in prncpls tht unite nd lead us onward. America hs nvr bn ntd by blood r brth r soil. We are bnd by ideals tht mv us bynd our bckgrnds, lift us bv our ntrsts nd teach us wht it mns t b ctzns. Every chld must b taught these prncpls. Every ctzn must phld thm. And vry mmgrnt, by mbrcng these ideals, mks our cntry mr, nt lss, American. Today, w ffrm  new cmmtmnt t live out our ntn's prms thrgh cvlty, crg, cmpssn nd chrctr. America, at ts bst, mtchs  cmmtmnt t principle wth  cncrn fr cvlty. A cvl scty dmnds frm ch f us gd will nd rspct, fair dlng nd frgvnss. Some seem t blv tht our pltcs cn afford t b ptty bcs, in  tm f peace, th stks f our debates ppr smll. But th stks fr America are nvr smll. If our cntry ds nt lead th cause f frdm, it will nt b ld. If w do nt trn th hrts f chldrn twrd knwldg nd chrctr, w will lose their gfts nd ndrmn their dlsm. If w permit our cnmy t drift nd dcln, th vlnrbl will sffr mst. We must live p t th cllng w shr. Civility is nt  tctc r  sntmnt. It is th dtrmnd chc f trst vr cyncsm, f cmmnty vr chaos. And ths cmmtmnt, if w kp it, is  wy t shrd ccmplshmnt. America, at ts bst, is ls crgs. Our ntnl crg hs bn clr in tms f dprssn nd war, whn dfndng cmmn dangers defined our cmmn gd. Now w must choose if th xmpl f our fthrs nd mthrs will nspr us r cndmn us. We must shw crg in  tm f blssng by cnfrntng prblms nstd f pssng thm on t ftr gnrtns. Together, w will rclm America's schls, bfr gnrnc nd pthy clm mr yng lvs. We will rfrm Social Security nd Medicare, sparing our chldrn frm strggls w hv th pwr t prvnt. And w will rdc txs, t rcvr th mmntm f our cnmy nd rwrd th ffrt nd ntrprs f wrkng Americans. We will bld our dfnss bynd chllng, lest wknss nvt chllng. We will cnfrnt wpns f mss dstrctn, so tht  new century is spared new hrrrs. The enemies f lbrty nd our cntry shld mk no mstk: America rmns nggd in th wrld by hstry nd by chc, shpng  blnc f pwr tht fvrs frdm. We will dfnd our lls nd our ntrsts. We will shw prps wtht rrgnc. We will mt ggrssn nd bd fth wth rslv nd strngth. And t ll ntns, w will spk fr th vls tht gave our ntn brth. America, at ts bst, is cmpssnt. In th quiet f American cnscnc, w knw tht dp, prsstnt pvrty is nwrthy f our ntn's prms. And whtvr our vws f ts cause, w cn gr tht chldrn at rsk are nt at fault. Abandonment nd abuse are nt acts f God, thy are flrs f love. And th prlfrtn f prisons, hwvr ncssry, is no sbsttt fr hp nd rdr in our souls. Where thr is sffrng, thr is dty. Americans in need are nt strngrs, thy are ctzns, nt prblms, bt prrts. And ll f us are dmnshd whn ny are hplss. Government hs grt rspnsblts fr pblc sfty nd pblc hlth, fr cvl rghts nd cmmn schls. Yet cmpssn is th wrk f  ntn, nt jst  gvrnmnt. And some nds nd hurts are so dp thy will nly rspnd t  mentor's tch r  pastor's pryr. Church nd chrty, syngg nd msq lend our cmmnts their hmnty, nd thy will hv an hnrd plc in our plns nd in our lws. Many in our cntry do nt knw th pain f pvrty, bt w cn lstn t those wh do. And I cn pldg our ntn t  gl: When w see tht wndd trvlr on th road t Jericho, w will nt pss t th other side. America, at ts bst, is  plc whr prsnl rspnsblty is vld nd xpctd. Encouraging rspnsblty is nt  srch fr scpgts, it is  cll t cnscnc. And thgh it rqrs scrfc, it brngs  dpr flfllmnt. We fnd th fllnss f lf nt nly in ptns, bt in cmmtmnts. And w fnd tht chldrn nd cmmnty are th cmmtmnts tht st us free. Our pblc ntrst dpnds on prvt chrctr, on cvc dty nd fmly bnds nd bsc frnss, on ncntd, unhonored acts f dcncy whch gv drctn t our frdm. Sometimes in lf w are clld t do grt thngs. But s  saint f our tms hs said, vry dy w are clld t do smll thngs wth grt love. The mst mprtnt tsks f  dmcrcy are dn by vryn. I will live nd lead by these prncpls: t dvnc my cnvctns wth cvlty, t prs th pblc ntrst wth crg, t spk fr grtr jstc nd cmpssn, t cll fr rspnsblty nd try t live it s wll. In ll these wys, I will brng th vls f our hstry t th cr f our tms. What y do is s mprtnt s nythng gvrnmnt ds. I ask y t sk  cmmn gd bynd your cmfrt; t dfnd needed rfrms gnst easy ttcks; t srv your ntn, bgnnng wth your nghbr. I ask y t b ctzns: ctzns, nt spcttrs; ctzns, nt sbjcts; rspnsbl ctzns, bldng cmmnts f srvc nd  ntn f chrctr. Americans are gnrs nd strng nd dcnt, nt bcs w blv in rslvs, bt bcs w hld blfs bynd rslvs. When ths spirit f ctznshp is mssng, no gvrnmnt prgrm cn rplc it. When ths spirit is prsnt, no wrng cn stnd gnst it. After th Declaration f Independence ws sgnd, Virginia sttsmn John Page wrote t Thomas Jefferson: "We knw th rc is nt t th swft nr th bttl t th strng. Do y nt thnk an angel rides in th whrlwnd nd drcts ths storm?" Much tm hs pssd snc Jefferson rrvd fr his ngrtn. The yrs nd chngs ccmlt. But th thms f ths dy h wld knw: our ntn's grand stry f crg nd ts smpl drm f dgnty. We are nt ths stry's author, wh fills tm nd eternity wth his prps. Yet his prps is chvd in our dty, nd our dty is flflld in srvc t n nthr. Never tiring, nvr yldng, nvr fnshng, w rnw tht prps tdy, t mk our cntry mr jst nd gnrs, t ffrm th dgnty f our lvs nd vry lf. This wrk cntns. This stry gs on. And an angel stll rides in th whrlwnd nd drcts ths storm. God blss y ll, nd God blss America.
