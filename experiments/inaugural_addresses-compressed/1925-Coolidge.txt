 My cntrymn, no n cn cntmplt crrnt cndtns wtht fndng mch tht is stsfyng nd stll mr tht is ncrgng. Our wn cntry is ldng th wrld in th gnrl rdjstmnt t th rslts f th grt cnflct.

Already w hv sffcntly rrrngd our dmstc affairs so tht cnfdnc hs rtrnd, bsnss hs rvvd, nd w ppr t b ntrng an era f prsprty whch is grdlly rchng into vry prt f th Nation. Realizing tht w cn nt live unto rslvs ln, w hv cntrbtd f our rsrcs nd our cnsl t th rlf f th sffrng nd th sttlmnt f th dspts mng th European ntns. Because f wht America is nd wht America hs dn,  firmer crg,  hghr hp, nsprs th hrt f ll hmnty. These rslts hv nt ccrrd by mere chnc. They hv bn scrd by  cnstnt nd nlghtnd ffrt mrkd by mny scrfcs nd xtndng vr mny gnrtns. We cn nt cntn these brllnt sccsss in th ftr, nlss w cntn t lrn frm th pst. It is ncssry t kp th frmr xprncs f our cntry bth at home nd abroad cntnlly bfr us, if w are t hv ny scnc f gvrnmnt. If w wsh t erect new strctrs, w must hv  dfnt knwldg f th old fndtns. We must rlz tht hmn nature is about th mst cnstnt thng in th nvrs nd tht th ssntls f hmn rltnshp do nt chng. We must frqntly tk our bearings frm these fxd stars f our pltcl frmmnt if w xpct t hld  tr crs. If w xmn crflly wht w hv dn, w cn dtrmn th mr ccrtly wht w cn do. We stnd at th pnng f th n hndrd nd fftth yr snc our ntnl cnscsnss frst ssrtd tslf by nmstkbl ctn wth an rry f frc. The old sntmnt f dtchd nd dpndnt clns dspprd in th new sntmnt f  ntd nd ndpndnt Nation. Men began t dscrd th nrrw cnfns f  lcl chrtr fr th brdr pprtnts f  ntnl cnstttn.

The nrrw fringe f States along th Atlantic sbrd dvncd ts frntrs crss th hlls nd plains f an ntrvnng cntnnt ntl it pssd dwn th gldn slope t th Pacific. We md frdm  brthrght. We xtndd our dmn vr dstnt slnds in rdr t sfgrd our wn ntrsts nd ccptd th cnsqnt blgtn t bstw jstc nd lbrty pn lss fvrd peoples. In th dfns f our wn ideals nd in th gnrl cause f lbrty w ntrd th Great War. When vctry hd bn flly scrd, w withdrew t our wn shores unrecompensed sv in th cnscsnss f dty dn. Throughout ll these xprncs w hv nlrgd our frdm, w hv strngthnd our ndpndnc. We hv bn, nd propose t b, mr nd mr American. We blv tht w cn bst srv our wn cntry nd mst sccssflly dschrg our blgtns t hmnty by cntnng t b pnly nd cnddly, in tensely nd scrplsly, American. If w hv ny hrtg, it hs bn tht. If w hv ny dstny, w hv found it in tht drctn. But if w wsh t cntn t b dstnctvly American, w must cntn t mk tht trm cmprhnsv ngh t mbrc th lgtmt dsrs f  cvlzd nd nlghtnd ppl dtrmnd in ll their rltns t prs  cnscnts nd rlgs lf. We cn nt permit rslvs t b nrrwd nd dwrfd by slgns nd phrss. It is nt th djctv, bt th sbstntv, whch is f rl mprtnc. It is nt th nm f th ctn, bt th rslt f th ctn, whch is th chf cncrn. It will b wll nt t b too mch dstrbd by th thght f either isolation r ntnglmnt f pcfsts nd mltrsts. The physcl cnfgrtn f th rth hs sprtd us frm ll f th Old World, bt th cmmn brthrhd f man, th hghst lw f ll our bng, hs ntd us by nsprbl bnds wth ll hmnty. Our cntry rprsnts nthng bt pcfl ntntns twrd ll th rth, bt it ought nt t fail t mntn sch  mltry frc s cmprts wth th dgnty nd scrty f  grt ppl. It ought t b  blncd frc, ntnsly modem, cpbl f dfns by sea nd lnd, bnth th srfc nd in th air. But it shld b so cndctd tht ll th wrld my see in it, nt  menace, bt an nstrmnt f scrty nd peace. This Nation blvs thrghly in an hnrbl peace ndr whch th rghts f ts ctzns are t b vrywhr prtctd. It hs nvr found tht th ncssry njymnt f sch  peace cld b mntnd nly by  grt nd thrtnng rry f rms. In cmmn wth other ntns, it is nw mr dtrmnd thn ever t prmt peace thrgh frndlnss nd gd will, thrgh mtl ndrstndngs nd mtl frbrnc. We hv nvr prctcd th plcy f cmpttv rmmnts. We hv rcntly cmmttd rslvs by cvnnts wth th other grt ntns t  lmttn f our sea pwr. As n rslt f ths, our Navy rnks lrgr, in cmprsn, thn it ever dd bfr. Removing th brdn f xpns nd jlsy, whch must lwys accrue frm  kn rvlry, is n f th mst ffctv mthds f dmnshng tht nrsnbl hystr nd msndrstndng whch are th mst potent mns f fmntng war. This plcy rprsnts  new dprtr in th wrld. It is  thght, an ideal, whch hs ld t an ntrly new line f ctn. It will nt b easy t mntn. Some nvr mvd frm their old pstns, some are cnstntly slppng bck t th old wys f thght nd th old ctn f szng  mskt nd rlyng on frc. America hs tkn th lead in ths new drctn, nd tht lead America must cntn t hld. If w xpct thrs t rely on our frnss nd jstc w must shw tht w rely on their frnss nd jstc. If w are t jdg by pst xprnc, thr is mch t b hpd fr in ntrntnl rltns frm frqnt cnfrncs nd cnslttns. We hv bfr us th bnfcl rslts f th Washington cnfrnc nd th vrs cnslttns rcntly held pn European affairs, some f whch wr in rspns t our sggstns nd in some f whch w wr ctv prtcpnts. Even th flrs cn nt bt b ccntd sfl nd an mmsrbl dvnc vr thrtnd r ctl wrfr. I am strngly in fvr f continuation f ths plcy, whnvr cndtns are sch tht thr is vn  prms tht prctcl nd fvrbl rslts mght b scrd. In cnfrmty wth th principle tht  dsply f rsn rthr thn  thrt f frc shld b th dtrmnng fctr in th ntrcrs mng ntns, w hv lng dvctd th pcfl sttlmnt f dspts by mthds f rbtrtn nd hv ngttd mny treaties t scr tht rslt. The sm cnsdrtns shld lead t our dhrnc t th Permanent Court f International Justice. Where grt prncpls are nvlvd, whr grt mvmnts are ndr wy whch prms mch fr th wlfr f hmnty by rsn f th very fct tht mny other ntns hv gvn sch mvmnts their ctl spprt, w ought nt t withhold our wn snctn bcs f ny smll nd nssntl dffrnc, bt nly pn th grnd f th mst mprtnt nd cmpllng fndmntl rsns. We cn nt brtr away our ndpndnc r our svrgnty, bt w ought t ngg in no rfnmnts f lgc, no sophistries, nd no sbtrfgs, t rg away th undoubted dty f ths cntry by rsn f th mght f ts nmbrs, th pwr f ts rsrcs, nd ts pstn f ldrshp in th wrld, ctvly nd cmprhnsvly t sgnfy ts pprvl nd t br ts fll shr f th rspnsblty f  cndd nd dsntrstd ttmpt at th stblshmnt f  trbnl fr th dmnstrtn f even-handed jstc btwn ntn nd ntn. The wght f our nrms nflnc must b cast pn th side f  reign nt f frc bt f lw nd trl, nt by bttl bt by rsn. We hv nvr ny wsh t ntrfr in th pltcl cndtns f ny other cntrs. Especially are w dtrmnd nt t bcm mplctd in th pltcl cntrvrss f th Old World. With  grt dl f hsttn, w hv rspndd t ppls fr hlp t mntn rdr, prtct lf nd prprty, nd stblsh rspnsbl gvrnmnt in some f th smll cntrs f th Western Hemisphere. Our prvt ctzns hv dvncd lrg sums f money t ssst in th ncssry fnncng nd rlf f th Old World. We hv nt fld, nr shll w fail t rspnd, whnvr ncssry t mtgt hmn sffrng nd ssst in th rhblttn f dstrssd ntns. These, too, are rqrmnts whch must b met by rsn f our vst pwrs nd th plc w hld in th wrld. Some f th bst thght f mnknd hs lng bn skng fr  formula fr prmnnt peace. Undoubtedly th clrfctn f th prncpls f ntrntnl lw wld b hlpfl, nd th ffrts f schlrs t prepare sch  wrk fr dptn by th vrs ntns shld hv our sympthy nd spprt. Much my b hpd fr frm th rnst stds f those wh dvct th tlwng f ggrssv war. But ll these plns nd prprtns, these treaties nd cvnnts, will nt f thmslvs b dqt. One f th grtst dangers t peace lies in th cnmc prssr t whch ppl fnd thmslvs sbjctd. One f th mst prctcl thngs t b dn in th wrld is t sk rrngmnts ndr whch sch prssr my b rmvd, so tht pprtnty my b rnwd nd hp my b rvvd. There must b some ssrnc tht ffrt nd ndvr will b fllwd by sccss nd prsprty. In th mkng nd fnncng f sch djstmnts thr is nt nly an pprtnty, bt  rl dty, fr America t rspnd wth her cnsl nd her rsrcs. Conditions must b prvdd ndr whch ppl cn mk  living nd wrk out f their dffclts. But thr is nthr element, mr mprtnt thn ll, wtht whch thr cn nt b th slghtst hp f  prmnnt peace. That element lies in th hrt f hmnty. Unless th dsr fr peace b chrshd thr, nlss ths fndmntl nd nly ntrl src f brthrly love b cltvtd t ts hghst dgr, ll rtfcl ffrts will b in vain. Peace will cm whn thr is rlztn tht nly ndr  reign f lw, bsd on rghtsnss nd spprtd by th rlgs cnvctn f th brthrhd f man, cn thr b ny hp f  cmplt nd stsfyng lf. Parchment will fail, th swrd will fail, it is nly th sprtl nature f man tht cn b trmphnt. It sms ltgthr prbbl tht w cn cntrbt mst t these mprtnt bjcts by mntnng our pstn f pltcl dtchmnt nd ndpndnc. We are nt dntfd wth ny Old World ntrsts. This pstn shld b md mr nd mr clr in our rltns wth ll frgn cntrs. We are at peace wth ll f thm. Our prgrm is nvr t pprss, bt lwys t ssst. But whl w do jstc t thrs, w must rqr tht jstc b dn t us. With us  trty f peace mns peace, nd  trty f amity mns amity. We hv md grt cntrbtns t th sttlmnt f contentious dffrncs in bth Europe nd Asia. But thr is  very dfnt pnt bynd whch w cn nt go. We cn nly hlp those wh hlp thmslvs. Mindful f these lmttns, th n grt dty tht stnds out rqrs us t use our nrms pwrs t trim th blnc f th wrld. While w cn look wth  grt dl f plsr pn wht w hv dn abroad, w must rmmbr tht our cntnd sccss in tht drctn dpnds pn wht w do at home. Since ts very outset, it hs bn found ncssry t cndct our Government by mns f pltcl parties. That systm wld nt hv srvvd frm gnrtn t gnrtn if it hd nt bn fndmntlly sound nd prvdd th bst nstrmntlts fr th mst cmplt xprssn f th pplr will. It is nt ncssry t clm tht it hs lwys wrkd prfctly. It is ngh t knw tht nthng bttr hs bn devised. No n wld dny tht thr shld b fll nd free xprssn nd an pprtnty fr ndpndnc f ctn wthn th prty. There is no slvtn in  nrrw nd bgtd prtsnshp. But if thr is t b rspnsbl prty gvrnmnt, th prty lbl must b smthng mr thn  mere device fr scrng ffc. Unless those wh are lctd ndr th sm prty dsgntn are wllng t ssm sffcnt rspnsblty nd xhbt sffcnt lylty nd coherence, so tht thy cn cprt wth ch other in th spprt f th broad gnrl prncpls, f th prty pltfrm, th election is mrly  mckry, no dcsn is md at th plls, nd thr is no rprsnttn f th pplr will. Common hnsty nd gd fth wth th ppl wh spprt  prty at th plls rqr tht prty, whn it ntrs ffc, t ssm th cntrl f tht prtn f th Government t whch it hs bn lctd. Any other crs is bd fth nd  violation f th prty pldgs. When th cntry hs bstwd ts cnfdnc pn  prty by mkng it  mjrty in th Congress, it hs  rght t xpct sch nty f ctn s will mk th prty mjrty an ffctv nstrmnt f gvrnmnt. This Administration hs cm into pwr wth  very clr nd dfnt mndt frm th ppl. The xprssn f th pplr will in fvr f mntnng our cnstttnl grnts ws vrwhlmng nd dcsv. There ws  mnfsttn f sch fth in th ntgrty f th courts tht w cn cnsdr tht ss rjctd fr some tm t cm. Likewise, th plcy f pblc wnrshp f rlrds nd crtn lctrc utilities met wth nmstkbl dft. The ppl dclrd tht thy wntd their rghts t hv nt  pltcl bt  jdcl dtrmntn, nd their ndpndnc nd frdm cntnd nd spprtd by hvng th wnrshp nd cntrl f their prprty, nt in th Government, bt in their wn hnds. As thy lwys do whn thy hv  fair chnc, th ppl dmnstrtd tht thy are sound nd are dtrmnd t hv  sound gvrnmnt. When w trn frm wht ws rjctd t nqr wht ws ccptd, th plcy tht stnds out wth th grtst clrnss is tht f cnmy in pblc xpndtr wth rdctn nd rfrm f txtn. The principle nvlvd in ths ffrt is tht f cnsrvtn. The rsrcs f ths cntry are lmst bynd computation. No mnd cn cmprhnd thm. But th cst f our cmbnd gvrnmnts is lkws lmst bynd dfntn. Not nly those wh are nw mkng their tx rtrns, bt those wh mt th nhncd cst f xstnc in their mnthly blls, knw by hrd xprnc wht ths grt brdn is nd wht it ds. No mttr wht thrs my wnt, these ppl wnt  drstc cnmy. They are ppsd t waste. They knw tht xtrvgnc lngthns th hrs nd dmnshs th rwrds f their lbr. I fvr th plcy f cnmy, nt bcs I wsh t sv money, bt bcs I wsh t sv ppl. The men nd wmn f ths cntry wh toil are th ns wh br th cst f th Government. Every dllr tht w crlssly waste mns tht their lf will b so mch th mr mgr. Every dllr tht w prdntly sv mns tht their lf will b so mch th mr bndnt. Economy is dlsm in ts mst prctcl form. If xtrvgnc wr nt rflctd in txtn, nd thrgh txtn bth drctly nd ndrctly injuriously ffctng th ppl, it wld nt b f so mch cnsqnc. The wsst nd sndst mthd f slvng our tx prblm is thrgh cnmy. Fortunately, f ll th grt ntns ths cntry is bst in  pstn t dpt tht smpl rmdy. We do nt ny lngr need wrtm rvns. The cllctn f ny taxes whch are nt bsltly rqrd, whch do nt bynd rsnbl dbt cntrbt t th pblc wlfr, is nly  spcs f lglzd lrcny. Under ths rpblc th rwrds f ndstry blng t those wh earn thm. The nly cnstttnl tx is th tx whch mnstrs t pblc ncssty. The prprty f th cntry blngs t th ppl f th cntry. Their title is bslt. They do nt spprt ny prvlgd clss; thy do nt need t mntn grt mltry frcs; thy ought nt t b brdnd wth  grt rry f pblc mplys. They are nt rqrd t mk ny cntrbtn t Government xpndtrs xcpt tht whch thy vlntrly ssss pn thmslvs thrgh th ctn f their wn rprsnttvs. Whenever taxes bcm brdnsm  rmdy cn b ppld by th ppl; bt if thy do nt act fr thmslvs, no n cn b very sccssfl in acting fr thm. The tm is rrvng whn w cn hv frthr tx rdctn, whn, nlss w wsh t hmpr th ppl in their rght t earn  living, w must hv tx rfrm. The mthd f rsng rvn ought nt t mpd th trnsctn f bsnss; it ought t ncrg it. I am ppsd t xtrmly hgh rates, bcs thy prdc lttl r no rvn, bcs thy are bd fr th cntry, nd, fnlly, bcs thy are wrng. We cn nt fnnc th cntry, w cn nt mprv scl cndtns, thrgh ny systm f njstc, vn if w ttmpt t nflct it pn th rich. Those wh sffr th mst hrm will b th pr. This cntry blvs in prsprty. It is bsrd t spps tht it is envious f those wh are lrdy prsprs. The wise nd crrct crs t fllw in txtn nd ll other cnmc lgsltn is nt t dstry those wh hv lrdy scrd sccss bt t crt cndtns ndr whch vry n will hv  bttr chnc t b sccssfl. The vrdct f th cntry hs bn gvn on ths qstn. That vrdct stnds. We shll do wll t heed it. These qstns nvlv mrl sss. We need nt cncrn rslvs mch about th rghts f prprty if w will fthflly bsrv th rghts f prsns. Under our nstttns their rghts are sprm. It is nt prprty bt th rght t hld prprty, bth grt nd smll, whch our Constitution grnts. All wnrs f prprty are chrgd wth  srvc. These rghts nd dts hv bn rvld, thrgh th cnscnc f scty, t hv  dvn snctn. The very stblty f our scty rsts pn prdctn nd cnsrvtn. For ndvdls r fr gvrnmnts t waste nd sqndr their rsrcs is t dny these rghts nd dsrgrd these blgtns. The rslt f cnmc dssptn t  ntn is lwys mrl dcy. These policies f bttr ntrntnl ndrstndngs, grtr cnmy, nd lwr taxes hv cntrbtd lrgly t pcfl nd prsprs ndstrl rltns. Under th hlpfl nflncs f rstrctv mmgrtn nd  prtctv trff, mplymnt is plntfl, th rt f py is hgh, nd wg rnrs are in  stt f cntntmnt sldm bfr sn. Our trnsprttn systms hv bn grdlly rcvrng nd hv bn bl t mt ll th rqrmnts f th srvc. Agriculture hs bn ver slw in rvvng, bt th prc f cereals at last ndcts tht th dy f ts dlvrnc is at hnd. We are nt wtht our prblms, bt our mst mprtnt prblm is nt t scr new dvntgs bt t mntn those whch w lrdy pssss. Our systm f gvrnmnt md p f three sprt nd ndpndnt dprtmnts, our dvdd svrgnty cmpsd f Nation nd State, th mtchlss wsdm tht is nshrnd in our Constitution, ll these need cnstnt ffrt nd trlss vglnc fr their prtctn nd spprt. In  rpblc th frst rule fr th gdnc f th ctzn is bdnc t lw. Under  dsptsm th lw my b mpsd pn th sbjct. He hs no vc in ts mkng, no nflnc in ts dmnstrtn, it ds nt rprsnt hm. Under  free gvrnmnt th ctzn mks his wn lws, chss his wn dmnstrtrs, whch do rprsnt hm. Those wh wnt their rghts rspctd ndr th Constitution nd th lw ought t st th xmpl thmslvs f bsrvng th Constitution nd th lw. While thr my b those f hgh ntllgnc wh violate th lw at tms, th brbrn nd th dfctv lwys violate it. Those wh dsrgrd th rls f scty are nt xhbtng  sprr ntllgnc, are nt prmtng frdm nd ndpndnc, are nt fllwng th pth f cvlztn, bt are dsplyng th traits f gnrnc, f srvtd, f svgry, nd treading th wy tht lds bck t th jngl. The ssnc f  rpblc is rprsnttv gvrnmnt. Our Congress rprsnts th ppl nd th States. In ll lgsltv affairs it is th ntrl cllbrtr wth th President. In spt f ll th crtcsm whch ftn flls t ts lt, I do nt hstt t sy tht thr is no mr ndpndnt nd ffctv lgsltv bdy in th wrld. It is, nd shld b, jealous f ts prrgtv. I wlcm ts cprtn, nd xpct t shr wth it nt nly th rspnsblty, bt th crdt, fr our cmmn ffrt t scr bnfcl lgsltn. These are some f th prncpls whch America rprsnts. We hv nt by ny mns pt thm flly into prctc, bt w hv strngly sgnfd our blf in thm. The ncrgng feature f our cntry is nt tht it hs rchd ts dstntn, bt tht it hs vrwhlmngly xprssd ts dtrmntn t prcd in th rght drctn. It is tr tht w cld, wth prft, b lss sctnl nd mr ntnl in our thght.

The pst nd prsnt shw fth nd hp nd crg flly jstfd. Here stnds our cntry, an xmpl f trnqllty at home,  ptrn f trnqllty abroad. Here stnds ts Government, aware f ts mght bt bdnt t ts cnscnc. Here it will cntn t stnd, skng peace nd prsprty, solicitous fr th wlfr f th wg rnr, prmtng ntrprs, dvlpng wtrwys nd ntrl rsrcs, ttntv t th intuitive cnsl f wmnhd, ncrgng dctn, dsrng th dvncmnt f rlgn, spprtng th cause f jstc nd hnr mng th ntns. America sks no rthly mpr blt on blood nd frc. No mbtn, no tmpttn, lures her t thght f frgn dmnns. The lgns whch sh sends frth are rmd, nt wth th swrd, bt wth th cross.
