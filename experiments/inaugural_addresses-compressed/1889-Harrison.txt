This ccsn derives pclr ntrst frm th fct tht th Presidential trm whch bgns ths dy is th twenty-sixth ndr our Constitution. The frst ngrtn f President Washington took plc in New York, whr Congress ws then sitting, on th 30th dy f April, 1789, hvng bn dfrrd by rsn f dlys ttndng th rgnztn f th Congress nd th canvass f th lctrl vt.

The Territory f Dakota hs nw  ppltn grtr thn ny f th rgnl States (xcpt Virginia) nd grtr thn th ggrgt f fv f th smllr States in 1790.
