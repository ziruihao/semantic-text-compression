 Senator Hatfield, Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. President, Vice President Bush, Vice President Mondale, Senator Baker, Speaker O'Neill, Reverend Moomaw, nd my fellow ctzns: To  fw f us hr tdy, ths is  slmn nd mst momentous ccsn; nd yt, in th hstry f our Nation, it is  cmmnplc ccrrnc. The rdrly trnsfr f thrty s clld fr in th Constitution rtnly tks plc s it hs fr lmst tw centuries nd fw f us stop t thnk hw nq w rlly are. In th eyes f mny in th wrld, ths every-4-year crmny w ccpt s nrml is nthng lss thn  mrcl. Mr. President, I wnt our fellow ctzns t knw hw mch y dd t crry on ths trdtn. By your grcs cprtn in th trnstn prcss, y hv shwn  wtchng wrld tht w are  ntd ppl pldgd t mntnng  pltcl systm whch grnts ndvdl lbrty t  grtr dgr thn ny other, nd I thank y nd your ppl fr ll your hlp in mntnng th cntnty whch is th blwrk f our Republic. The bsnss f our ntn gs frwrd. These United States are cnfrntd wth an cnmc fflctn f grt proportions. We sffr frm th lngst nd n f th wrst sstnd nfltns in our ntnl hstry. It dstrts our cnmc dcsns, pnlzs thrft, nd crushes th strgglng yng nd th fixed-income ldrly alike. It thrtns t shttr th lvs f mllns f our ppl. Idle ndstrs hv cast wrkrs into nmplymnt, csng hmn msry nd prsnl ndgnty. Those wh do wrk are dnd  fair rtrn fr their lbr by  tx systm whch pnlzs sccssfl chvmnt nd kps us frm mntnng fll prdctvty. But grt s our tx brdn is, it hs nt kpt pace wth pblc spndng. For dcds, w hv piled dfct pn dfct, mrtggng our ftr nd our chldrn's ftr fr th tmprry cnvnnc f th prsnt. To cntn ths lng trend is t grnt trmnds scl, cltrl, pltcl, nd cnmc phvls. You nd I, s ndvdls, cn, by brrwng, live bynd our mns, bt fr nly  lmtd prd f tm. Why, then, shld w thnk tht cllctvly, s  ntn, w are nt bnd by tht sm lmttn? We must act tdy in rdr t prsrv tmrrw. And let thr b no msndrstndng--w are gng t bgn t act, bgnnng tdy. The cnmc ills w sffr hv cm pn us vr svrl dcds. They will nt go away in dys, wks, r mnths, bt thy will go away. They will go away bcs w, s Americans, hv th cpcty nw, s w hv hd in th pst, t do whtvr nds t b dn t prsrv ths last nd grtst bastion f frdm. In ths prsnt crisis, gvrnmnt is nt th sltn t our prblm. From tm t tm, w hv bn tmptd t blv tht scty hs bcm too cmplx t b mngd by self-rule, tht gvrnmnt by an elite grp is sprr t gvrnmnt fr, by, nd f th ppl. But if no n mng us is cpbl f gvrnng hmslf, then wh mng us hs th cpcty t gvrn smn else? All f us tgthr, in nd out f gvrnmnt, must br th brdn. The sltns w sk must b qtbl, wth no n grp sngld out t py  hghr prc. We hear mch f spcl ntrst grps. Our cncrn must b fr  spcl ntrst grp tht hs bn too lng nglctd. It knws no sctnl bndrs r thnc nd rcl dvsns, nd it crsss pltcl prty lns. It is md p f men nd wmn wh rs our fd, ptrl our streets, man our mines nd our factories, teach our chldrn, kp our hms, nd heal us whn w are sck--prfssnls, ndstrlsts, shpkprs, clrks, cbbs, nd truckdrivers. They are, in shrt, "We th ppl," ths breed clld Americans. Well, ths dmnstrtn's bjctv will b  hlthy, vgrs, grwng cnmy tht prvds ql pprtnty fr ll Americans, wth no brrrs born f bgtry r dscrmntn. Putting America bck t wrk mns pttng ll Americans bck t wrk. Ending nfltn mns freeing ll Americans frm th trrr f runaway living csts. All must shr in th prdctv wrk f ths "new bgnnng" nd ll must shr in th bnty f  rvvd cnmy. With th dlsm nd fair ply whch are th core f our systm nd our strngth, w cn hv  strng nd prsprs America at peace wth tslf nd th wrld. So, s w bgn, let us tk nvntry. We are  ntn tht hs  gvrnmnt--nt th other wy rnd. And ths mks us spcl mng th ntns f th Earth. Our Government hs no pwr xcpt tht grntd it by th ppl. It is tm t chck nd rvrs th grwth f gvrnmnt whch shws sgns f hvng grwn bynd th cnsnt f th gvrnd. It is my ntntn t crb th sz nd nflnc f th Federal stblshmnt nd t dmnd rcgntn f th dstnctn btwn th pwrs grntd t th Federal Government nd those rsrvd t th States r t th ppl. All f us need t b rmndd tht th Federal Government dd nt crt th States; th States crtd th Federal Government. Now, so thr will b no msndrstndng, it is nt my ntntn t do away wth gvrnmnt. It is, rthr, t mk it wrk--wrk wth us, nt vr us; t stnd by our side, nt ride on our bck. Government cn nd must prvd pprtnty, nt smother it; foster prdctvty, nt stfl it. If w look t th nswr s t why, fr so mny yrs, w chvd so mch, prsprd s no other ppl on Earth, it ws bcs hr, in ths lnd, w nlshd th nrgy nd ndvdl genius f man t  grtr xtnt thn hs ever bn dn bfr. Freedom nd th dgnty f th ndvdl hv bn mr vlbl nd ssrd hr thn in ny other plc on Earth. The prc fr ths frdm at tms hs bn hgh, bt w hv nvr bn nwllng t py tht prc. It is no cncdnc tht our prsnt trbls prlll nd are prprtnt t th ntrvntn nd ntrsn in our lvs tht rslt frm nncssry nd xcssv grwth f gvrnmnt. It is tm fr us t rlz tht w are too grt  ntn t lmt rslvs t smll drms. We are nt, s some wld hv us blv, lmd t an nvtbl dcln. I do nt blv in  fate tht will ll on us no mttr wht w do. I do blv in  fate tht will fall on us if w do nthng. So, wth ll th crtv nrgy at our cmmnd, let us bgn an era f ntnl rnwl. Let us rnw our dtrmntn, our crg, nd our strngth. And let us rnw; our fth nd our hp. We hv vry rght t drm hrc drms. Those wh sy tht w are in  tm whn thr are no heroes jst don't knw whr t look. You cn see heroes vry dy gng in nd out f fctry gates. Others,  hndfl in nmbr, prdc ngh fd t feed ll f us nd then th wrld bynd. You mt heroes crss  cntr--nd thy are on bth sds f tht cntr. There are ntrprnrs wth fth in thmslvs nd fth in an d wh crt new jbs, new wlth nd pprtnty. They are ndvdls nd fmls whs taxes spprt th Government nd whs vlntry gfts spprt chrch, chrty, cltr, art, nd dctn. Their ptrtsm is quiet bt dp. Their vls sstn our ntnl lf. I hv sd th wrds "thy" nd "their" in spkng f these heroes. I cld sy "y" nd "your" bcs I am ddrssng th heroes f whm I spk--y, th ctzns f ths blssd lnd. Your drms, your hps, your gls are gng t b th drms, th hps, nd th gls f ths dmnstrtn, so hlp me God. We shll rflct th cmpssn tht is so mch  prt f your mkp. How cn w love our cntry nd nt love our cntrymn, nd loving thm, rch out  hnd whn thy fall, heal thm whn thy are sck, nd prvd pprtnts t mk thm self- sffcnt so thy will b ql in fct nd nt jst in thry? Can w slv th prblms cnfrntng us? Well, th nswr is an nqvcl nd mphtc "ys." To prphrs Winston Churchill, I dd nt tk th oath I hv jst tkn wth th ntntn f presiding vr th dssltn f th wrld's strngst cnmy. In th dys ahead I will propose rmvng th rdblcks tht hv slwd our cnmy nd rdcd prdctvty. Steps will b tkn aimed at rstrng th blnc btwn th vrs lvls f gvrnmnt. Progress my b slw--msrd in nchs nd feet, nt mls--bt w will prgrss. Is it tm t reawaken ths ndstrl gnt, t gt gvrnmnt bck wthn ts mns, nd t lghtn our pntv tx brdn. And these will b our frst prrts, nd on these prncpls, thr will b no cmprms. On th eve f our strggl fr ndpndnc  man wh mght hv bn n f th grtst mng th Founding Fathers, Dr. Joseph Warren, President f th Massachusetts Congress, said t his fellow Americans, "Our cntry is in dngr, bt nt t b despaired f .... On y dpnd th frtns f America. You are t decide th mprtnt qstns pn whch rsts th hppnss nd th lbrty f mllns yt nbrn. Act wrthy f yrslvs." Well, I blv w, th Americans f tdy, are rdy t act wrthy f rslvs, rdy t do wht must b dn t nsr hppnss nd lbrty fr rslvs, our chldrn nd our chldrn's chldrn. And s w rnw rslvs hr in our wn lnd, w will b sn s hvng grtr strngth thrght th wrld. We will gn b th xmplr f frdm nd  bcn f hp fr those wh do nt nw hv frdm. To those nghbrs nd lls wh shr our frdm, w will strngthn our hstrc ties nd ssr thm f our spprt nd firm cmmtmnt. We will mtch lylty wth lylty. We will strv fr mtlly bnfcl rltns. We will nt use our frndshp t mps on their svrgnty, fr r wn svrgnty is nt fr sale. As fr th enemies f frdm, those wh are ptntl dvrsrs, thy will b rmndd tht peace is th hghst aspiration f th American ppl. We will ngtt fr it, scrfc fr it; w will nt srrndr fr it--nw r ever. Our frbrnc shld nvr b msndrstd. Our rlctnc fr cnflct shld nt b msjdgd s  flr f will. When ctn is rqrd t prsrv our ntnl scrty, w will act. We will mntn sffcnt strngth t prvl if need b, knwng tht if w do so w hv th bst chnc f nvr hvng t use tht strngth. Above ll, w must rlz tht no rsnl, r no wpn in th rsnls f th wrld, is so frmdbl s th will nd mrl crg f free men nd wmn. It is  wpn our dvrsrs in tdy's wrld do nt hv. It is  wpn tht w s Americans do hv. Let tht b ndrstd by those wh prctc trrrsm nd prey pn their nghbrs. I am tld tht tns f thsnds f pryr mtngs are bng held on ths dy, nd fr tht I am dply grtfl. We are  ntn ndr God, nd I blv God ntndd fr us t b free. It wld b fttng nd gd, I thnk, if on ch Inauguration Day in ftr yrs it shld b dclrd  dy f pryr. This is th frst tm in hstry tht ths crmny hs bn held, s y hv bn tld, on ths West Front f th Capitol. Standing hr, n faces  mgnfcnt vista, pnng p on ths cty's spcl bty nd hstry. At th end f ths open mall are those shrns t th giants on whs shldrs w stnd. Directly in frnt f me, th mnmnt t  mnmntl man: George Washington, Father f our cntry. A man f hmlty wh came t grtnss rlctntly. He ld America out f rvltnry vctry into nfnt ntnhd. Off t n side, th sttly mmrl t Thomas Jefferson. The Declaration f Independence flames wth his lqnc. And then bynd th Reflecting Pool th dgnfd clmns f th Lincoln Memorial. Whoever wld ndrstnd in his hrt th mnng f America will fnd it in th lf f Abraham Lincoln. Beyond those mnmnts t hrsm is th Potomac River, nd on th far shore th sloping hlls f Arlington National Cemetery wth ts rw on rw f smpl white mrkrs bearing crsss r Stars f David. They add p t nly  tny frctn f th prc tht hs bn pd fr our frdm. Each n f those mrkrs is  mnmnt t th knds f hero I spoke f rlr. Their lvs ended in plcs clld Belleau Wood, The Argonne, Omaha Beach, Salerno nd hlfwy rnd th wrld on Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Pork Chop Hill, th Chosin Reservoir, nd in  hndrd rice pdds nd jngls f  plc clld Vietnam. Under n sch mrkr lies  yng man wh lft his jb in  smll town barber shop in 1917 t go t France wth th fmd Rainbow Division. There, on th wstrn frnt, h ws klld tryng t crry  mssg btwn bttlns ndr hvy rtllry fire. We are tld tht on his bdy ws found  diary. On th flylf ndr th hdng, "My Pledge," h hd wrttn these wrds: "America must win ths war. Therefore, I will wrk, I will sv, I will scrfc, I will endure, I will fght chrflly nd do my tmst, s if th ss f th whole strggl dpndd on me ln." The crisis w are fcng tdy ds nt rqr f us th knd f scrfc tht Martin Treptow nd so mny thsnds f thrs wr clld pn t mk. It ds rqr, hwvr, our bst ffrt, nd our wllngnss t blv in rslvs nd t blv in our cpcty t prfrm grt deeds; t blv tht tgthr, wth God's hlp, w cn nd will rslv th prblms whch nw cnfrnt us. And, after ll, why shldn't w blv tht? We are Americans. God blss y, nd thank y.
