One f th mst mprssv vdncs f tht wsdm is t b found in th fct tht th ctl wrkng f our systm hs dsplld  dgr f solicitude whch at th outset dstrbd bold hrts nd far-reaching ntllcts. The pprhnsn f dangers frm xtndd trrtry, mltpld States, ccmltd wlth, nd gmntd ppltn hs proved t b nfndd.

An Administration wld b nwrthy f cnfdnc at home r rspct abroad shld it cease t b nflncd by th cnvctn tht no pprnt dvntg cn b prchsd at  prc so dear s tht f ntnl wrng r dshnr.

But th vst ntrsts f cmmrc are cmmn t ll mnknd, nd th dvntgs f trade nd ntrntnl ntrcrs must lwys prsnt  noble field fr th mrl nflnc f  grt ppl. With these vws frmly nd hnstly crrd out, w hv  rght t xpct, nd shll ndr ll crcmstncs rqr, prmpt rcprcty. The rghts whch blng t us s  ntn are nt ln t b rgrdd, bt those whch pertain t vry ctzn in his ndvdl cpcty, at home nd abroad, must b sacredly mntnd.
