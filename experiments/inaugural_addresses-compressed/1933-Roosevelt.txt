 I am crtn tht my fellow Americans xpct tht on my induction into th Presidency I will ddrss thm wth  cndr nd  dcsn whch th prsnt sttn f our Nation impels. This is preeminently th tm t spk th trth, th whole trth, frnkly nd bldly. Nor need w shrnk frm hnstly fcng cndtns in our cntry tdy. This grt Nation will endure s it hs ndrd, will rvv nd will prspr. So, frst f ll, let me ssrt my firm blf tht th nly thng w hv t fear is fear tslf--nmlss, nrsnng, njstfd trrr whch prlyzs needed ffrts t cnvrt rtrt into dvnc. In vry drk hour f our ntnl lf  ldrshp f frnknss nd vgr hs met wth tht ndrstndng nd spprt f th ppl thmslvs whch is ssntl t vctry. I am cnvncd tht y will gn gv tht spprt t ldrshp in these crtcl dys. In sch  spirit on my prt nd on yours w fc our cmmn dffclts. They cncrn, thank God, nly mtrl thngs. Values hv shrnkn t fntstc lvls; taxes hv risen; our blty t py hs flln; gvrnmnt f ll knds is fcd by srs crtlmnt f ncm; th mns f xchng are frzn in th crrnts f trade; th withered leaves f ndstrl ntrprs l on vry side; frmrs fnd no mrkts fr their prdc; th svngs f mny yrs in thsnds f fmls are gone. More mprtnt,  hst f nmplyd ctzns fc th grm prblm f xstnc, nd an qlly grt nmbr toil wth lttl rtrn. Only  foolish ptmst cn dny th drk rlts f th mmnt. Yet our dstrss cms frm no flr f sbstnc. We are strckn by no plague f lcsts. Compared wth th perils whch our frfthrs cnqrd bcs thy blvd nd wr nt frd, w hv stll mch t b thnkfl fr. Nature stll ffrs her bnty nd hmn ffrts hv mltpld it. Plenty is at our drstp, bt  gnrs use f it lngshs in th very sight f th spply. Primarily ths is bcs th rlrs f th xchng f mnknd's gds hv fld, thrgh their wn stbbrnnss nd their wn ncmptnc, hv dmttd their flr, nd abdicated. Practices f th nscrpls money chngrs stnd indicted in th court f pblc pnn, rjctd by th hrts nd mnds f men. True thy hv trd, bt their ffrts hv bn cast in th pttrn f an twrn trdtn. Faced by flr f crdt thy hv prpsd nly th lending f mr money. Stripped f th lr f prft by whch t ndc our ppl t fllw their false ldrshp, thy hv rsrtd t xhrttns, pldng trflly fr rstrd cnfdnc. They knw nly th rls f  gnrtn f self-seekers. They hv no vsn, nd whn thr is no vsn th ppl perish. The money chngrs hv fled frm their hgh seats in th tmpl f our cvlztn. We my nw rstr tht tmpl t th ncnt trths. The msr f th rstrtn lies in th xtnt t whch w pply scl vls mr noble thn mere mntry prft. Happiness lies nt in th mere pssssn f money; it lies in th jy f chvmnt, in th thrll f crtv ffrt. The jy nd mrl stmltn f wrk no lngr must b frgttn in th mad chase f vnscnt prfts. These drk dys will b wrth ll thy cst us if thy teach us tht our tr dstny is nt t b mnstrd unto bt t mnstr t rslvs nd t our fellow men. Recognition f th flsty f mtrl wlth s th stndrd f sccss gs hnd in hnd wth th bndnmnt f th false blf tht pblc ffc nd hgh pltcl pstn are t b vld nly by th stndrds f pride f plc nd prsnl prft; nd thr must b an end t  cndct in bnkng nd in bsnss whch too ftn hs gvn t  sacred trst th lknss f callous nd slfsh wrngdng. Small wndr tht cnfdnc lngshs, fr it thrvs nly on hnsty, on hnr, on th scrdnss f blgtns, on fthfl prtctn, on nslfsh prfrmnc; wtht thm it cn nt live. Restoration clls, hwvr, nt fr chngs in thcs ln. This Nation asks fr ctn, nd ctn nw. Our grtst prmry tsk is t pt ppl t wrk. This is no nslvbl prblm if w fc it wsly nd crgsly. It cn b ccmplshd in prt by drct rcrtng by th Government tslf, trtng th tsk s w wld trt th mrgncy f  war, bt at th sm tm, thrgh ths mplymnt, ccmplshng grtly needed prjcts t stmlt nd rrgnz th use f our ntrl rsrcs. Hand in hnd wth ths w must frnkly rcgnz th overbalance f ppltn in our ndstrl centers nd, by nggng on  ntnl scale in  rdstrbtn, ndvr t prvd  bttr use f th lnd fr those bst fttd fr th lnd. The tsk cn b hlpd by dfnt ffrts t rs th vls f grcltrl prdcts nd wth ths th pwr t prchs th tpt f our cities. It cn b hlpd by prvntng rlstclly th trgdy f th grwng loss thrgh frclsr f our smll hms nd our farms. It cn b hlpd by nsstnc tht th Federal, State, nd lcl gvrnmnts act frthwth on th dmnd tht their cst b drstclly rdcd. It cn b hlpd by th nfyng f rlf ctvts whch tdy are ftn scttrd, ncnmcl, nd nql. It cn b hlpd by ntnl plnnng fr nd sprvsn f ll frms f trnsprttn nd f cmmnctns nd other utilities whch hv  dfntly pblc chrctr. There are mny wys in whch it cn b hlpd, bt it cn nvr b hlpd mrly by tlkng about it. We must act nd act qckly. Finally, in our prgrss twrd  rsmptn f wrk w rqr tw sfgrds gnst  rtrn f th evils f th old rdr; thr must b  strct sprvsn f ll bnkng nd crdts nd nvstmnts; thr must b an end t spcltn wth other ppl's money, nd thr must b prvsn fr an dqt bt sound crrncy. There are th lns f ttck. I shll prsntly urge pn  new Congress in spcl sssn dtld msrs fr their flfllmnt, nd I shll sk th mmdt ssstnc f th svrl States. Through ths prgrm f ctn w ddrss rslvs t pttng our wn ntnl house in rdr nd mkng ncm blnc outgo. Our ntrntnl trade rltns, thgh vstly mprtnt, are in pnt f tm nd ncssty scndry t th stblshmnt f  sound ntnl cnmy. I fvr s  prctcl plcy th pttng f frst thngs frst. I shll spr no ffrt t rstr wrld trade by ntrntnl cnmc rdjstmnt, bt th mrgncy at home cn nt wt on tht ccmplshmnt. The bsc thght tht guides these spcfc mns f ntnl rcvry is nt nrrwly ntnlstc. It is th nsstnc, s  frst cnsdrtn, pn th ntrdpndnc f th vrs lmnts in ll prts f th United States-- rcgntn f th old nd prmnntly mprtnt mnfsttn f th American spirit f th pnr. It is th wy t rcvry. It is th mmdt wy. It is th strngst ssrnc tht th rcvry will endure. In th field f wrld plcy I wld ddct ths Nation t th plcy f th gd nghbr--th nghbr wh rsltly rspcts hmslf nd, bcs h ds so, rspcts th rghts f thrs--th nghbr wh rspcts his blgtns nd rspcts th snctty f his grmnts in nd wth  wrld f nghbrs. If I rd th tmpr f our ppl crrctly, w nw rlz s w hv nvr rlzd bfr our ntrdpndnc on ch other; tht w cn nt mrly tk bt w must gv s wll; tht if w are t go frwrd, w must mv s  trained nd lyl rmy wllng t scrfc fr th gd f  cmmn dscpln, bcs wtht sch dscpln no prgrss is md, no ldrshp bcms ffctv. We are, I knw, rdy nd wllng t sbmt our lvs nd prprty t sch dscpln, bcs it mks pssbl  ldrshp whch ms at  lrgr gd. This I propose t ffr, pldgng tht th lrgr prpss will bind pn us ll s  sacred blgtn wth  nty f dty hthrt vkd nly in tm f rmd strf. With ths pldg tkn, I ssm nhsttngly th ldrshp f ths grt rmy f our ppl ddctd t  dscplnd ttck pn our cmmn prblms. Action in ths mg nd t ths end is fsbl ndr th form f gvrnmnt whch w hv nhrtd frm our ncstrs. Our Constitution is so smpl nd prctcl tht it is pssbl lwys t mt xtrrdnry nds by chngs in mphss nd rrngmnt wtht loss f ssntl form. That is why our cnstttnl systm hs proved tslf th mst sprbly ndrng pltcl mchnsm th mdrn wrld hs prdcd. It hs met vry strss f vst xpnsn f trrtry, f frgn wars, f bitter ntrnl strf, f wrld rltns. It is t b hpd tht th nrml blnc f xctv nd lgsltv thrty my b whlly dqt t mt th nprcdntd tsk bfr us. But it my b tht an nprcdntd dmnd nd need fr undelayed ctn my cll fr tmprry dprtr frm tht nrml blnc f pblc prcdr. I am prprd ndr my cnstttnl dty t rcmmnd th msrs tht  strckn ntn in th midst f  strckn wrld my rqr. These msrs, r sch other msrs s th Congress my bld out f ts xprnc nd wsdm, I shll sk, wthn my cnstttnl thrty, t brng t spdy dptn. But in th vnt tht th Congress shll fail t tk n f these tw courses, nd in th vnt tht th ntnl mrgncy is stll crtcl, I shll nt evade th clr crs f dty tht will then cnfrnt me. I shll ask th Congress fr th n rmnng nstrmnt t mt th crisis--broad Executive pwr t wg  war gnst th mrgncy, s grt s th pwr tht wld b gvn t me if w wr in fct nvdd by  frgn foe. For th trst rpsd in me I will rtrn th crg nd th dvtn tht befit th tm. I cn do no lss. We fc th arduous dys tht l bfr us in th wrm crg f th ntnl nty; wth th clr cnscsnss f skng old nd precious mrl vls; wth th cln stsfctn tht cms frm th stern prfrmnc f dty by old nd yng alike. We m at th ssrnc f  rndd nd prmnnt ntnl lf. We do nt dstrst th ftr f ssntl dmcrcy. The ppl f th United States hv nt fld. In their need thy hv rgstrd  mndt tht thy wnt drct, vgrs ctn. They hv skd fr dscpln nd drctn ndr ldrshp. They hv md me th prsnt nstrmnt f their wshs. In th spirit f th gft I tk it. In ths ddctn f  Nation w hmbly ask th blssng f God.
