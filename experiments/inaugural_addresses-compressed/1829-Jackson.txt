 Fellow ctzns, about t ndrtk th arduous duties tht I hv bn ppntd t prfrm by th chc f  free ppl, I avail myslf f ths cstmry nd slmn ccsn t xprss th grttd whch their cnfdnc nsprs nd t cknwldg th ccntblty whch my sttn njns. While th mgntd f their ntrsts cnvncs me tht no thnks cn b dqt t th hnr thy hv cnfrrd, it admonishes me tht th bst rtrn I cn mk is th zls ddctn f my hmbl blts t their srvc nd their gd. As th nstrmnt f th Federal Constitution it will dvlv on me fr  sttd prd t execute th lws f th United States, t sprntnd their frgn nd their cnfdrt rltns, t manage their rvn, t cmmnd their frcs, nd, by cmmnctns t th Legislature, t wtch vr nd t prmt their ntrsts gnrlly. And th prncpls f ctn by whch I shll ndvr t ccmplsh ths circle f duties it is nw prpr fr me brfly t xpln. In dmnstrng th lws f Congress I shll kp stdly in vw th lmttns s wll s th xtnt f th Executive pwr trstng thrby t dschrg th fnctns f my ffc wtht trnscndng ts thrty. With frgn ntns it will b my stdy t prsrv peace nd t cltvt frndshp on fair nd hnrbl trms, nd in th djstmnt f ny dffrncs tht my xst r arise t xhbt th frbrnc bcmng  pwrfl ntn rthr thn th snsblty blngng t  gllnt ppl. In sch msrs s I my b clld on t prs in rgrd t th rghts f th sprt States I hp t b nmtd by  prpr rspct fr those svrgn mmbrs f our Union, tkng care nt t confound th pwrs thy hv rsrvd t thmslvs wth those thy hv grntd t th Confederacy. The mngmnt f th pblc rvn--tht srchng operation in ll gvrnmnts--is mng th mst dlct nd mprtnt trusts in ours, nd it will, f crs, dmnd no ncnsdrbl shr f my ffcl solicitude. Under vry spct in whch it cn b cnsdrd it wld ppr tht dvntg must rslt frm th bsrvnc f  strct nd fthfl cnmy. This I shll m at th mr nxsly bth bcs it will fcltt th xtngshmnt f th ntnl debt, th nncssry drtn f whch is ncmptbl wth rl ndpndnc, nd bcs it will counteract tht tndncy t pblc nd prvt prflgcy whch  profuse xpndtr f money by th Government is bt too apt t ngndr. Powerful xlrs t th ttnmnt f ths dsrbl end are t b found in th rgltns prvdd by th wsdm f Congress fr th spcfc pprprtn f pblc money nd th prmpt ccntblty f pblc ffcrs. With rgrd t  prpr slctn f th sbjcts f impost wth  vw t rvn, it wld seem t me tht th spirit f qty, caution nd cmprms in whch th Constitution ws frmd rqrs tht th grt ntrsts f grcltr, cmmrc, nd mnfctrs shld b qlly fvrd, nd tht prhps th nly xcptn t ths rule shld cnsst in th pclr ncrgmnt f ny prdcts f either f thm tht my b found ssntl t our ntnl ndpndnc. Internal mprvmnt nd th dffsn f knwldg, so far s thy cn b prmtd by th cnstttnl acts f th Federal Government, are f hgh mprtnc. Considering stndng armies s dngrs t free gvrnmnts in tm f peace, I shll nt sk t nlrg our prsnt stblshmnt, nr dsrgrd tht salutary lssn f pltcl xprnc whch teaches tht th mltry shld b held sbrdnt t th cvl pwr. The grdl ncrs f our Navy, whs flg hs dsplyd in dstnt climes our skll in nvgtn nd our fm in rms; th prsrvtn f our forts, rsnls, nd dckyrds, nd th ntrdctn f prgrssv mprvmnts in th dscpln nd scnc f bth brnchs f our mltry srvc are so plnly prscrbd by prdnc tht I shld b xcsd fr omitting their mention sooner thn fr nlrgng on their mprtnc. But th blwrk f our dfns is th ntnl militia, whch in th prsnt stt f our ntllgnc nd ppltn must rndr us nvncbl. As lng s our Government is dmnstrd fr th gd f th ppl, nd is rgltd by their will; s lng s it secures t us th rghts f prsn nd f prprty, lbrty f cnscnc nd f th prss, it will b wrth dfndng; nd so lng s it is wrth dfndng  ptrtc militia will cvr it wth an mpntrbl aegis. Partial njrs nd ccsnl mortifications w my b sbjctd t, bt  mlln f rmd freemen, pssssd f th mns f war, cn nvr b cnqrd by  frgn foe. To ny jst systm, thrfr, clcltd t strngthn ths ntrl sfgrd f th cntry I shll chrflly lend ll th aid in my pwr. It will b my sncr nd cnstnt dsr t bsrv twrd th Indian trbs wthn our lmts  jst nd lbrl plcy, nd t gv tht humane nd cnsdrt ttntn t their rghts nd their wnts whch is cnsstnt wth th hbts f our Government nd th flngs f our ppl. The rcnt demonstration f pblc sntmnt nscrbs on th list f Executive dts, in chrctrs too legible t b vrlkd, th tsk f rfrm, whch will rqr prtclrly th crrctn f those abuses tht hv brght th ptrng f th Federal Government into cnflct wth th frdm f lctns, nd th counteraction f those causes whch hv dstrbd th rghtfl crs f ppntmnt nd hv plcd r cntnd pwr in nfthfl r ncmptnt hnds. In th prfrmnc f  tsk thus gnrlly dlntd I shll ndvr t slct men whs dlgnc nd tlnts will insure in their rspctv stations bl nd fthfl cprtn, dpndng fr th dvncmnt f th pblc srvc mr on th ntgrty nd zl f th pblc ffcrs thn on their nmbrs. A dffdnc, prhps too jst, in my wn qlfctns will teach me t look wth rvrnc t th xmpls f pblc vrt lft by my llstrs prdcssrs, nd wth vnrtn t th lghts tht flw frm th mnd tht fndd nd th mnd tht rfrmd our systm. The sm dffdnc induces me t hp fr nstrctn nd aid frm th crdnt brnchs f th Government, nd fr th ndlgnc nd spprt f my fellow ctzns gnrlly. And  firm rlnc on th gdnss f tht Power whs prvdnc mrcflly prtctd our ntnl nfncy, nd hs snc upheld our lbrts in vrs vcsstds, ncrgs me t ffr p my rdnt spplctns tht He will cntn t mk our beloved cntry th bjct f His dvn care nd grcs benediction.
