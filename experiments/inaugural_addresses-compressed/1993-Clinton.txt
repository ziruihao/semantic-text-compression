 My fellow ctzns, tdy w clbrt th mystry f American rnwl. This crmny is held in th dpth f wntr, bt by th wrds w spk nd th faces w shw th wrld, w frc th sprng. A sprng reborn in th wrld's ldst dmcrcy, tht brngs frth th vsn nd crg t rnvnt America. When our fndrs bldly dclrd America's ndpndnc t th wrld, nd our prpss t th Almighty, thy knew tht America, t endure, wld hv t chng. Not chng fr chng sake, bt chng t prsrv America's ideals: lf, lbrty, th prst f hppnss. Though w mrch t th msc f our tm, our mssn is tmlss. Each gnrtn f American's must dfn wht it mns t b an American. On bhlf f our ntn, I salute my prdcssr, President Bush, fr his half-century f srvc t America nd I thank th mllns f men nd wmn whs stdfstnss nd scrfc trmphd vr dprssn, fscsm nd cmmnsm. Today,  gnrtn rsd in th shdws f th Cold War ssms new rspnsblts in  wrld wrmd by th snshn f frdm, bt thrtnd stll by ncnt htrds nd new plagues. Raised in nrvlld prsprty, w nhrt an cnmy tht is stll th wrld's strngst, bt is weakened by bsnss flrs, stgnnt wgs, ncrsng nqlty, nd dp dvsns mng our wn ppl. When George Washington frst took th oath I hv jst swrn t phld, nws trvlld slwly crss th lnd by hrsbck, nd crss th ocean by boat. Now th sghts nd snds f ths crmny are brdcst nstntnsly tobillions rnd th wrld. Communications nd cmmrc are glbl. Investment is mbl. Technology is lmst mgcl, nd mbtn fr  bttr lf is nw nvrsl. We earn our lvlhd in America tdy in pcfl cmpttn wth ppl ll crss th Earth. Profound nd pwrfl frcs are shkng nd rmkng our wrld, nd th rgnt qstn f our tm is whthr w cn mk chng our frnd nd nt our nmy. This new wrld hs lrdy nrchd th lvs f mllns f Americans wh are bl t cmpt nd win in it. But whn mst ppl are wrkng hrdr fr lss, whn thrs cn nt wrk at ll, whn th cst f hlth cr dvstts fmls nd thrtns t bnkrpt our ntrprss, grt nd smll; whn th fear f crm robs lw bdng ctzns f their frdm; nd whn mllns f pr chldrn cn nt vn mgn th lvs w are cllng thm t lead, w hv nt md chng our frnd. We knw w hv t fc hrd trths nd tk strng stps, bt w hv nt dn so. Instead w hv drifted, nd tht drifting hs rdd our rsrcs, frctrd our cnmy, nd shkn our cnfdnc. Though our chllngs are frsm, so are our strngths. Americans hv ever bn  rstlss, qstng, hpfl ppl, nd w must brng t our tsk tdy th vsn nd will f those wh came bfr us. From our Revolution t th Civil War, t th Great Depression, t th Civil Rights mvmnt, our ppl hv lwys mustered th dtrmntn t cnstrct frm these crises th pllrs f our hstry. Thomas Jefferson blvd tht t prsrv th very fndtns f our ntn w wld need drmtc chng frm tm t tm. Well, my fellow Americans, ths is our tm. Let us mbrc it. Our dmcrcy must b nt nly th envy f th wrld bt th ngn f our wn rnwl. There is nthng wrng wth America tht cn nt b cured by wht is rght wth America. And so tdy w pldg an end t th era f ddlck nd drift, nd  new ssn f American rnwl hs begun. To rnw America w must b bold. We must do wht no gnrtn hs hd t do bfr. We must nvst mr in our wn ppl, in their jbs, nd in their ftr, nd at th sm tm ct our mssv debt nd w must do so in  wrld in whch w must cmpt fr vry pprtnty. It will nt b easy. It will rqr scrfc, bt it cn b dn, nd dn frly. Not chsng scrfc fr ts wn sake, bt fr our wn sake. We must prvd fr our ntn th wy  fmly prvds fr ts chldrn. Our fndrs sw thmslvs in th lght f pstrty. We cn do no lss. Anyone wh hs ever wtchd  chld's eyes wander into sleep knws wht pstrty is. Posterity is th wrld t cm, th wrld fr whm w hld our ideals, frm whm w hv brrwd our planet, nd t whm w br sacred rspnsblts. We must do wht America ds bst, ffr mr pprtnty t ll nd dmnd mr rspnsblty frm ll. It is tm t brk th bd hbt f xpctng smthng fr nthng: frm our gvrnmnt, r frm ch other. Let us ll tk mr rspnsblty, nt nly fr rslvs nd our fmls, bt fr our cmmnts nd our cntry. To rnw America w must rvtlz our dmcrcy. This btfl capitol, lk vry capitol snc th dawn f cvlztn, is ftn  plc f intrigue nd clcltn. Powerful ppl mnvr fr pstn nd wrry ndlssly about wh is in nd wh is out, wh is p nd wh is dwn, frgttng those ppl whs toil nd sweat sends us hr nd pvs our wy. Americans dsrv bttr, nd in ths cty tdy thr are ppl wh wnt t do bttr, nd so I sy t ll f y hr, let us rslv t rfrm our pltcs, so tht pwr nd prvlg no lngr shout dwn th vc f th ppl. Let us pt aside prsnl dvntg, so tht w cn fl th pain nd see th prms f America. Let us rslv t mk our gvrnmnt  plc fr wht Franklin Roosevelt clld "bold, prsstnt xprmnttn,  gvrnmnt fr our tmrrws, nt our ystrdys." Let us gv ths capitol bck t th ppl t whm it blngs. To rnw America w must mt chllngs abroad, s wll s at home. There is no lngr  clr dvsn btwn wht is frgn nd wht is dmstc. The wrld cnmy, th wrld nvrnmnt, th wrld AIDS crisis, th wrld rms rc: thy affect us ll. Today s an old rdr psss, th new wrld is mr free, bt lss stbl. Communism's cllps hs clld frth old animosities, nd new dangers. Clearly, America must cntn t lead th wrld w dd so mch t mk. While America rblds at home, w will nt shrnk frm th chllngs nr fail t seize th pprtnts f ths new wrld. Together wth our frnds nd lls, w will wrk tgthr t shp chng, lest it nglf us. When our vtl ntrsts are chllngd, r th will nd cnscnc f th ntrntnl cmmnty is dfd, w will act; wth pcfl dplmcy whnvr pssbl, wth frc whn ncssry. The brv Americans srvng our ntn tdy in th Persian Gulf, in Somalia, nd whrvr else thy stnd, are tstmnt t our rslv, bt our grtst strngth is th pwr f our ideas, whch are stll new in mny lnds. Across th wrld, w see thm mbrcd nd w rjc. Our hps, our hrts, our hnds, are wth those on vry cntnnt, wh are bldng dmcrcy nd frdm. Their cause is America's cause. The American ppl hv smmnd th chng w clbrt tdy. You hv rsd your vcs in an nmstkbl chrs, y hv cast your vts in hstrc nmbrs, y hv chngd th fc f cngrss, th prsdncy, nd th pltcl prcss tslf. Yes, y, my fellow Americans, hv frcd th sprng. Now WE must do th wrk th ssn dmnds. To tht wrk I nw trn wth ALL th thrty f my ffc. I ask th cngrss t jn wth me; bt no prsdnt, no cngrss, no gvrnmnt cn ndrtk THIS mssn ln. My fellow Americans, y, too, must ply your prt in our rnwl. I chllng  new gnrtn f YOUNG Americans t  ssn f srvc, t act on your dlsm, by hlpng trbld chldrn, kpng cmpny wth those in need, rcnnctng our torn cmmnts. There is so mch t b dn. Enough, ndd, fr mllns f thrs wh are stll yng in spirit, t gv f thmslvs in srvc, too. In srvng w rcgnz  smpl, bt pwrfl, trth: w need ch other, nd w must cr fr n nthr. Today w do mr thn clbrt America, w rddct rslvs t th very d f America, an d born in rvltn, nd rnwd thrgh tw centuries f chllng, an d tmprd by th knwldg tht bt fr fate, w, th frtnt nd th nfrtnt, mght hv bn ch other; an d nnbld by th fth tht our ntn cn smmn frm ts myrd dvrsty, th deepest msr f nty; an d nfsd wth th cnvctn tht America's jrny lng, hrc jrny must go frvr pwrd. And so, my fellow Americans, s w stnd at th dg f th 21st Century, let us bgn anew, wth nrgy nd hp, wth fth nd dscpln, nd let us wrk ntl our wrk is dn. The Scripture sys: "And let us nt b weary in well-doing, fr in due ssn w shll reap, if w faint nt." From ths jyfl mntntp f clbrtn w hear  cll t srvc in th vlly. We hv heard th trmpts, w hv chngd th guard, nd nw ch in our wn wy, nd wth God's hlp, w must nswr th cll. Thank y, nd God blss y ll.
