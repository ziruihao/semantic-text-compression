 Mr. Vice President, Mr. Chief Justice, nd fellow ctzns, I ccpt wth hmlty th hnr whch th American ppl hv cnfrrd pn me. I ccpt it wth  dp rslv t do ll tht I cn fr th wlfr f ths Nation nd fr th peace f th wrld. In prfrmng th dts f my ffc, I need th hlp nd pryrs f vry n f y. I ask fr your ncrgmnt nd your spprt. The tsks w fc are dffclt, nd w cn ccmplsh thm nly if w wrk tgthr. Each prd f our ntnl hstry hs hd ts spcl chllngs. Those tht cnfrnt us nw are s momentous s ny in th pst. Today mrks th bgnnng nt nly f  new dmnstrtn, bt f  prd tht will b vntfl, prhps dcsv, fr us nd fr th wrld. It my b our lt t xprnc, nd in lrg msr t brng about,  mjr trnng pnt in th lng hstry f th hmn rc. The frst hlf f ths century hs bn mrkd by nprcdntd nd brtl ttcks on th rghts f man, nd by th tw mst frghtfl wars in hstry. The sprm need f our tm is fr men t lrn t live tgthr in peace nd hrmny. The peoples f th rth fc th ftr wth grv ncrtnty, cmpsd lmst qlly f grt hps nd grt frs. In ths tm f dbt, thy look t th United States s nvr bfr fr gd will, strngth, nd wise ldrshp. It is fttng, thrfr, tht w tk ths ccsn t prclm t th wrld th ssntl prncpls f th fth by whch w live, nd t dclr our ms t ll peoples. The American ppl stnd firm in th fth whch hs nsprd ths Nation frm th bgnnng. We blv tht ll men hv  rght t ql jstc ndr lw nd ql pprtnty t shr in th cmmn gd. We blv tht ll men hv th rght t frdm f thght nd xprssn. We blv tht ll men are crtd ql bcs thy are crtd in th mg f God. From ths fth w will nt b mvd. The American ppl dsr, nd are dtrmnd t wrk fr,  wrld in whch ll ntns nd ll peoples are free t gvrn thmslvs s thy see ft, nd t chv  dcnt nd stsfyng lf. Above ll else, our ppl dsr, nd are dtrmnd t wrk fr, peace on rth-- jst nd lstng peace--bsd on gnn grmnt freely rrvd at by qls. In th prst f these ms, th United States nd other like-minded ntns fnd thmslvs drctly ppsd by  rgm wth cntrry ms nd  ttlly dffrnt cncpt f lf. That rgm dhrs t  false phlsphy whch purports t ffr frdm, scrty, nd grtr pprtnty t mnknd. Misled by ths phlsphy, mny peoples hv scrfcd their lbrts nly t lrn t their srrw tht deceit nd mckry, pvrty nd tyrnny, are their rwrd. That false phlsphy is cmmnsm. Communism is bsd on th blf tht man is so weak nd ndqt tht h is nbl t gvrn hmslf, nd thrfr rqrs th rule f strng mstrs. Democracy is bsd on th cnvctn tht man hs th mrl nd ntllctl cpcty, s wll s th nlnbl rght, t gvrn hmslf wth rsn nd jstc. Communism sbjcts th ndvdl t rrst wtht lwfl cause, pnshmnt wtht trl, nd frcd lbr s th chttl f th stt. It decrees wht nfrmtn h shll rcv, wht art h shll prdc, wht ldrs h shll fllw, nd wht thghts h shll thnk. Democracy mntns tht gvrnmnt is stblshd fr th bnft f th ndvdl, nd is chrgd wth th rspnsblty f prtctng th rghts f th ndvdl nd his frdm in th xrcs f his blts. Communism mntns tht scl wrngs cn b crrctd nly by vlnc. Democracy hs proved tht scl jstc cn b chvd thrgh pcfl chng. Communism hlds tht th wrld is so dply dvdd into ppsng clsss tht war is nvtbl. Democracy hlds tht free ntns cn sttl dffrncs jstly nd mntn lstng peace. These dffrncs btwn cmmnsm nd dmcrcy do nt cncrn th United States ln. People vrywhr are cmng t rlz tht wht is nvlvd is mtrl well-being, hmn dgnty, nd th rght t blv in nd wrshp God. I stt these dffrncs, nt t drw sss f blf s sch, bt bcs th ctns rsltng frm th Communist phlsphy are  thrt t th ffrts f free ntns t brng about wrld rcvry nd lstng peace. Since th end f hstlts, th United States hs nvstd ts sbstnc nd ts nrgy in  grt cnstrctv ffrt t rstr peace, stblty, nd frdm t th wrld. We hv sght no trrtry nd w hv mpsd our will on nn. We hv skd fr no prvlgs w wld nt xtnd t thrs. We hv cnstntly nd vgrsly spprtd th United Nations nd rltd gncs s  mns f pplyng dmcrtc prncpls t ntrntnl rltns. We hv cnsstntly dvctd nd relied pn pcfl sttlmnt f dspts mng ntns. We hv md vry ffrt t scr grmnt on ffctv ntrntnl cntrl f our mst pwrfl wpn, nd w hv wrkd stdly fr th lmttn nd cntrl f ll rmmnts. We hv ncrgd, by prcpt nd xmpl, th xpnsn f wrld trade on  sound nd fair bss. Almost  yr g, in cmpny wth 16 free ntns f Europe, w lnchd th grtst cprtv cnmc prgrm in hstry. The prps f tht nprcdntd ffrt is t nvgrt nd strngthn dmcrcy in Europe, so tht th free ppl f tht cntnnt cn rsm their rghtfl plc in th frfrnt f cvlztn nd cn cntrbt nc mr t th scrty nd wlfr f th wrld. Our ffrts hv brght new hp t ll mnknd. We hv beaten bck dspr nd dftsm. We hv svd  nmbr f cntrs frm lsng their lbrty. Hundreds f mllns f ppl ll vr th wrld nw gr wth us, tht w need nt hv war--tht w cn hv peace. The nttv is ours. We are mvng on wth other ntns t bld an vn strngr strctr f ntrntnl rdr nd jstc. We shll hv s our prtnrs cntrs whch, no lngr solely cncrnd wth th prblm f ntnl srvvl, are nw wrkng t mprv th stndrds f living f ll their ppl. We are rdy t ndrtk new prjcts t strngthn th free wrld. In th cmng yrs, our prgrm fr peace nd frdm will mphsz four mjr courses f ctn. First, w will cntn t gv nfltrng spprt t th United Nations nd rltd gncs, nd w will cntn t srch fr wys t strngthn their thrty nd ncrs their ffctvnss. We blv tht th United Nations will b strngthnd by th new ntns whch are bng frmd in lnds nw dvncng twrd self-government ndr dmcrtc prncpls. Second, w will cntn our prgrms fr wrld cnmc rcvry. This mns, frst f ll, tht w must kp our fll wght bhnd th European rcvry prgrm. We are cnfdnt f th sccss f ths mjr vntr in wrld rcvry. We blv tht our prtnrs in ths ffrt will chv th status f self-supporting ntns nc gn. In ddtn, w must crry out our plns fr rdcng th brrrs t wrld trade nd ncrsng ts vlm. Economic rcvry nd peace tslf dpnd on ncrsd wrld trade. Third, w will strngthn freedom-loving ntns gnst th dangers f ggrssn. We are nw wrkng out wth  nmbr f cntrs  jnt grmnt dsgnd t strngthn th scrty f th North Atlantic area. Such an grmnt wld tk th form f  cllctv dfns rrngmnt wthn th trms f th United Nations Charter. We hv lrdy stblshd sch  dfns pct fr th Western Hemisphere by th trty f Rio de Janeiro. The prmry prps f these grmnts is t prvd nmstkbl prf f th jnt dtrmntn f th free cntrs t rsst rmd ttck frm ny qrtr. Each cntry prtcptng in these rrngmnts must cntrbt ll it cn t th cmmn dfns. If w cn mk it sffcntly clr, in dvnc, tht ny rmd ttck ffctng our ntnl scrty wld b met wth vrwhlmng frc, th rmd ttck mght nvr ccr. I hp soon t snd t th Senate  trty rspctng th North Atlantic scrty pln. In ddtn, w will prvd mltry dvc nd qpmnt t free ntns whch will cprt wth us in th mntnnc f peace nd scrty. Fourth, w must mbrk on  bold new prgrm fr mkng th bnfts f our scntfc dvncs nd ndstrl prgrss vlbl fr th mprvmnt nd grwth f ndrdvlpd areas. More thn hlf th ppl f th wrld are living in cndtns pprchng msry. Their fd is ndqt. They are vctms f dss. Their cnmc lf is prmtv nd stgnnt. Their pvrty is  hndcp nd  thrt bth t thm nd t mr prsprs areas. For th frst tm in hstry, hmnty psssss th knwldg nd th skll t rlv th sffrng f these ppl. The United States is pre-eminent mng ntns in th dvlpmnt f ndstrl nd scntfc tchnqs. The mtrl rsrcs whch w cn afford t use fr th ssstnc f other peoples are lmtd. But our mpndrbl rsrcs in tchncl knwldg are cnstntly grwng nd are nxhstbl. I blv tht w shld mk vlbl t peace-loving peoples th bnfts f our store f tchncl knwldg in rdr t hlp thm rlz their sprtns fr  bttr lf. And, in cprtn wth other ntns, w shld foster cptl nvstmnt in areas needing dvlpmnt. Our m shld b t hlp th free peoples f th wrld, thrgh their wn ffrts, t prdc mr fd, mr clthng, mr mtrls fr hsng, nd mr mchncl pwr t lghtn their brdns. We nvt other cntrs t pl their tchnlgcl rsrcs in ths ndrtkng. Their cntrbtns will b wrmly wlcmd. This shld b  cprtv ntrprs in whch ll ntns wrk tgthr thrgh th United Nations nd ts spclzd gncs whrvr prctcbl. It must b  wrldwd ffrt fr th chvmnt f peace, plnty, nd frdm. With th cprtn f bsnss, prvt cptl, grcltr, nd lbr in ths cntry, ths prgrm cn grtly ncrs th ndstrl ctvty in other ntns nd cn rs sbstntlly their stndrds f living. Such new cnmc dvlpmnts must b devised nd cntrlld t bnft th peoples f th areas in whch thy are stblshd. Guarantees t th nvstr must b blncd by grnts in th ntrst f th ppl whs rsrcs nd whs lbr go into these dvlpmnts. The old mprlsm--xplttn fr frgn prft--hs no plc in our plns. What w nvsg is  prgrm f dvlpmnt bsd on th cncpts f dmcrtc fair-dealing. All cntrs, ncldng our wn, will grtly bnft frm  cnstrctv prgrm fr th bttr use f th wrld's hmn nd ntrl rsrcs. Experience shws tht our cmmrc wth other cntrs xpnds s thy prgrss ndstrlly nd cnmclly. Greater prdctn is th ky t prsprty nd peace. And th ky t grtr prdctn is  wdr nd mr vgrs pplctn f mdrn scntfc nd tchncl knwldg. Only by hlpng th lst frtnt f ts mmbrs t hlp thmslvs cn th hmn fmly chv th dcnt, stsfyng lf tht is th rght f ll ppl. Democracy ln cn spply th vtlzng frc t stir th peoples f th wrld into trmphnt ctn, nt nly gnst their hmn pprssrs, bt ls gnst their ncnt enemies--hngr, msry, nd dspr. On th bss f these four mjr courses f ctn w hp t hlp crt th cndtns tht will lead vntlly t prsnl frdm nd hppnss fr ll mnknd. If w are t b sccssfl in crryng out these policies, it is clr tht w must hv cntnd prsprty in ths cntry nd w must kp rslvs strng. Slowly bt srly w are weaving  wrld fbrc f ntrntnl scrty nd grwng prsprty. We are aided by ll wh wsh t live in frdm frm fear--vn by those wh live tdy in fear ndr their wn gvrnmnts. We are aided by ll wh wnt rlf frm th lies f prpgnd--wh dsr trth nd sncrty. We are aided by ll wh dsr self-government nd  vc in dcdng their wn affairs. We are aided by ll wh lng fr cnmc scrty--fr th scrty nd bndnc tht men in free scts cn njy. We are aided by ll wh dsr frdm f spch, frdm f rlgn, nd frdm t live their wn lvs fr sfl ends. Our lls are th mllns wh hngr nd thirst after rghtsnss. In due tm, s our stblty bcms mnfst, s mr nd mr ntns cm t knw th bnfts f dmcrcy nd t prtcpt in grwng bndnc, I blv tht those cntrs whch nw pps us will bndn their dlsns nd jn wth th free ntns f th wrld in  jst sttlmnt f ntrntnl dffrncs. Events hv brght our American dmcrcy t new nflnc nd new rspnsblts. They will tst our crg, our dvtn t dty, nd our cncpt f lbrty. But I sy t ll men, wht w hv chvd in lbrty, w will srpss in grtr lbrty. Steadfast in our fth in th Almighty, w will dvnc twrd  wrld whr man's frdm is scr. To tht end w will dvt our strngth, our rsrcs, nd our frmnss f rslv. With God's hlp, th ftr f mnknd will b ssrd in  wrld f jstc, hrmny, nd peace.
