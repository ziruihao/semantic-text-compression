The rmnng rvn on th cnsmptn f frgn rtcls is pd chfly by those wh cn afford t add frgn luxuries t dmstc cmfrts, bng cllctd on our sbrd nd frntrs nly, nd ncrprtd wth th trnsctns f our mrcntl ctzns, it my b th plsr nd th pride f an American t ask, What farmer, wht mchnc, wht lbrr ever sees  taxgatherer f th United States? These cntrbtns enable us t spprt th crrnt xpnss f th Government, t flfll cntrcts wth frgn ntns, t xtngsh th ntv rght f soil wthn our lmts, t xtnd those lmts, nd t pply sch  srpls t our pblc debts s plcs at  shrt dy their fnl rdmptn, nd tht rdmptn nc effected th rvn thrby lbrtd my, by  jst rprttn f it mng th States nd  crrspndng mndmnt f th Constitution, b ppld in tm f peace t rivers, cnls, rds, arts, mnfctrs, dctn, nd other grt bjcts wthn ch State.

With whch shld w b mst lkly t live in hrmny nd frndly ntrcrs? In mttrs f rlgn I hv cnsdrd tht ts free xrcs is plcd by th Constitution ndpndnt f th pwrs f th General Government. I hv thrfr ndrtkn on no ccsn t prscrb th rlgs xrcss suited t it, bt hv lft thm, s th Constitution found thm, ndr th drctn nd dscpln f th chrch r stt thrts cknwldgd by th svrl rlgs scts. The brgnl nhbtnts f these cntrs I hv rgrdd wth th cmmsrtn their hstry nsprs. Endowed wth th faculties nd th rghts f men, brthng an rdnt love f lbrty nd ndpndnc, nd ccpyng  cntry whch lft thm no dsr bt t b ndstrbd, th strm f vrflwng ppltn frm other rgns drctd tslf on these shores; wtht pwr t dvrt r hbts t contend gnst it, thy hv bn vrwhlmd by th crrnt r drvn bfr it; nw rdcd wthn lmts too nrrw fr th hntr's stt, hmnty njns us t teach thm grcltr nd th dmstc arts; t ncrg thm t tht ndstry whch ln cn enable thm t mntn their plc in xstnc nd t prepare thm in tm fr tht stt f scty whch t bodily cmfrts dds th mprvmnt f th mnd nd morals. We hv thrfr lbrlly frnshd thm wth th mplmnts f hsbndry nd hshld use; w hv plcd mng thm nstrctrs in th arts f frst ncssty, nd thy are cvrd wth th aegis f th lw gnst ggrssrs frm mng rslvs. But th ndvrs t nlghtn thm on th fate whch awaits their prsnt crs f lf, t ndc thm t xrcs their rsn, fllw ts dctts, nd chng their pursuits wth th chng f crcmstncs hv pwrfl bstcls t ncntr; thy are cmbtd by th hbts f their bds, prjdcs f their mnds, gnrnc, pride, nd th nflnc f ntrstd nd crfty ndvdls mng thm wh fl thmslvs smthng in th prsnt rdr f thngs nd fear t bcm nthng in ny other. These prsns nclct  snctmns rvrnc fr th cstms f their ncstrs; tht whtsvr thy dd must b dn thrgh ll tm; tht rsn is  false guide, nd t dvnc ndr ts cnsl in their physcl, mrl, r pltcl cndtn is prls nnvtn; tht their dty is t rmn s their Creator md thm, gnrnc bng sfty nd knwldg fll f dngr; in shrt, my frnds, mng thm ls is sn th ctn nd counteraction f gd sns nd f bgtry; thy too hv their antiphilosophists wh fnd an ntrst in kpng thngs in their prsnt stt, wh dread rfrmtn, nd xrt ll their faculties t mntn th scndncy f hbt vr th dty f mprvng our rsn nd obeying ts mndts. In gvng these outlines I do nt mn, fellow ctzns, t arrogate t myslf th mrt f th msrs. That is due, in th frst plc, t th rflctng chrctr f our ctzns at lrg, wh, by th wght f pblc pnn, nflnc nd strngthn th pblc msrs. It is due t th sound dscrtn wth whch thy slct frm mng thmslvs those t whm thy cnfd th lgsltv dts. It is due t th zl nd wsdm f th chrctrs thus slctd, wh ly th fndtns f pblc hppnss in whlsm lws, th xctn f whch ln rmns fr thrs, nd it is due t th bl nd fthfl xlrs, whs ptrtsm hs ssctd thm wth me in th xctv fnctns. During ths crs f dmnstrtn, nd in rdr t dstrb it, th rtllry f th prss hs bn lvld gnst us, chrgd wth whtsvr ts lcntsnss cld devise r dare. These abuses f an nstttn so mprtnt t frdm nd scnc are dply t b rgrttd, nsmch s thy tnd t lessen ts sflnss nd t sap ts sfty. They mght, ndd, hv bn crrctd by th whlsm pnshmnts rsrvd t nd prvdd by th lws f th svrl States gnst falsehood nd dfmtn, bt pblc dts mr rgnt prss on th tm f pblc srvnts, nd th ffndrs hv thrfr bn lft t fnd their pnshmnt in th pblc ndgntn. Nor ws it nntrstng t th wrld tht an xprmnt shld b frly nd flly md, whthr frdm f dscssn, unaided by pwr, is nt sffcnt fr th prpgtn nd prtctn f trth--whthr  gvrnmnt cndctng tslf in th tr spirit f ts cnstttn, wth zl nd purity, nd dng no act whch it wld b nwllng th whole wrld shld wtnss, cn b wrttn dwn by falsehood nd dfmtn. The xprmnt hs bn trd; y hv wtnssd th scn; our fellow ctzns lkd on, cl nd cllctd; thy sw th ltnt src frm whch these outrages proceeded; thy gthrd rnd their pblc fnctnrs, nd whn th Constitution clld thm t th dcsn by sffrg, thy prnncd their vrdct, hnrbl t those wh hd srvd thm nd cnsltry t th frnd f man wh blvs tht h my b trstd wth th cntrl f his wn affairs. No nfrnc is hr ntndd tht th lws prvdd by th States gnst false nd dfmtry pblctns shld nt b nfrcd; h wh hs tm rndrs  srvc t pblc mrls nd pblc trnqllty in rfrmng these abuses by th salutary coercions f th lw; bt th xprmnt is noted t prv tht, snc trth nd rsn hv mntnd their grnd gnst false pnns in lg wth false fcts, th prss, cnfnd t trth, nds no other lgl rstrnt; th pblc jdgmnt will crrct false rsnng nd pnns on  fll hrng f ll parties; nd no other dfnt line cn b drwn btwn th nstmbl lbrty f th prss nd ts dmrlzng lcntsnss. If thr b stll mprprts whch ths rule wld nt rstrn, ts spplmnt must b sght in th cnsrshp f pblc pnn. Contemplating th union f sntmnt nw mnfstd so gnrlly s auguring hrmny nd hppnss t our ftr crs, I ffr t our cntry sncr cngrtltns. With those, too, nt yt rallied t th sm pnt th dspstn t do so is gnng strngth; fcts are piercing thrgh th veil drwn vr thm, nd our doubting brthrn will at lngth see tht th mss f their fellow ctzns wth whm thy cn nt yt rslv t act s t prncpls nd msrs, thnk s thy thnk nd dsr wht thy dsr; tht our wsh s wll s theirs is tht th pblc ffrts my b drctd hnstly t th pblc gd, tht peace b cltvtd, cvl nd rlgs lbrty unassailed, lw nd rdr prsrvd, equality f rghts mntnd, nd tht stt f prprty, ql r nql, whch rslts t vry man frm his wn ndstry r tht f his fthr's. When stsfd f these vws it is nt in hmn nature tht thy shld nt pprv nd spprt thm. In th mntm let us chrsh thm wth ptnt ffctn, let us do thm jstc, nd mr thn jstc, in ll cmpttns f ntrst; nd w need nt dbt tht trth, rsn, nd their wn ntrsts will at lngth prvl, will gthr thm into th fold f their cntry, nd will cmplt tht ntr union f pnn whch gvs t  ntn th blssng f hrmny nd th bnft f ll ts strngth. I shll nw enter on th dts t whch my fellow ctzns hv gn clld me, nd shll prcd in th spirit f those prncpls whch thy hv pprvd. I fear nt tht ny mtvs f ntrst my lead me astray; I am snsbl f no pssn whch cld sdc me knwngly frm th pth f jstc, bt th wknsss f hmn nature nd th lmts f my wn ndrstndng will prdc rrrs f jdgmnt smtms injurious t your ntrsts. I shll need, thrfr, ll th ndlgnc whch I hv hrtfr xprncd frm my cnsttnts; th wnt f it will crtnly nt lessen wth ncrsng yrs. I shll need, too, th fvr f tht Being in whs hnds w are, wh ld our fthrs, s Israel f old, frm their ntv lnd nd plntd thm in  cntry flwng wth ll th ncssrs nd cmfrts f lf; wh hs cvrd our nfncy wth His prvdnc nd our riper yrs wth His wsdm nd pwr, nd t whs gdnss I ask y t jn in spplctns wth me tht He will so nlghtn th mnds f your srvnts, guide their cncls, nd prspr their msrs tht whtsvr thy do shll rslt in your gd, nd shll scr t y th peace, frndshp, nd pprbtn f ll ntns.
