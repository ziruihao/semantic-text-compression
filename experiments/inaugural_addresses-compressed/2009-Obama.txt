 My fellow ctzns: I stnd hr tdy hmbld by th tsk bfr us, grtfl fr th trst y hv bstwd, mndfl f th scrfcs borne by our ncstrs. I thank President Bush fr his srvc t our ntn, s wll s th gnrsty nd cprtn h hs shwn thrght ths trnstn. Forty-four Americans hv nw tkn th prsdntl oath. The wrds hv bn spkn drng rising tides f prsprty nd th stll wtrs f peace. Yet, vry so ftn th oath is tkn amidst gthrng clds nd raging storms. At these mmnts, America hs crrd on nt smply bcs f th skll r vsn f those in hgh ffc, bt bcs We th People hv rmnd fthfl t th ideals f our frbrrs, nd tr t our founding dcmnts. So it hs bn. So it must b wth ths gnrtn f Americans. That w are in th midst f crisis is nw wll ndrstd. Our ntn is at war, gnst  far-reaching ntwrk f vlnc nd htrd. Our cnmy is bdly weakened,  cnsqnc f greed nd rrspnsblty on th prt f some, bt ls our cllctv flr t mk hrd chcs nd prepare th ntn fr  new age. Homes hv bn lost; jbs shd; bsnsss shuttered. Our hlth cr is too cstly; our schls fail too mny; nd ch dy brngs frthr vdnc tht th wys w use nrgy strngthn our dvrsrs nd thrtn our planet. These are th ndctrs f crisis, sbjct t data nd sttstcs. Less measurable bt no lss prfnd is  sapping f cnfdnc crss our lnd-- nagging fear tht America's dcln is nvtbl, tht th nxt gnrtn must lwr ts sghts. Today I sy t y tht th chllngs w fc are rl. They are srs nd thy are mny. They will nt b met sly r in  shrt span f tm. But knw ths, America--thy will b met. On ths dy, w gthr bcs w hv chsn hp vr fear, nty f prps vr cnflct nd discord. On ths dy, w cm t prclm an end t th ptty grvncs nd false prmss, th rcrmntns nd worn-out dgms tht fr far too lng hv strngld our pltcs. We rmn  yng ntn, bt in th wrds f Scripture, th tm hs cm t st aside chldsh thngs. The tm hs cm t rffrm our ndrng spirit; t choose our bttr hstry; t crry frwrd tht precious gft, tht noble d, pssd on frm gnrtn t gnrtn: th God-given prms tht ll are ql, ll are free, nd ll dsrv  chnc t prs their fll msr f hppnss. In rffrmng th grtnss f our ntn, w ndrstnd tht grtnss is nvr  gvn. It must b earned. Our jrny hs nvr bn n f shrtcts r sttlng fr lss. It hs nt bn th pth fr th faint-hearted--fr those wh prfr lsr vr wrk, r sk nly th plsrs f riches nd fm. Rather, it hs bn th risk-takers, th doers, th mkrs f things'some clbrtd bt mr ftn men nd wmn bscr in their lbr, wh hv crrd us p th lng, rggd pth twrds prsprty nd frdm. For us, thy packed p their fw wrldly pssssns nd trvld crss oceans in srch f  new lf. For us, thy toiled in swtshps nd sttld th West; ndrd th lash f th whp nd plwd th hrd rth. For us, thy fought nd died, in plcs lk Concord nd Gettysburg; Normandy nd Khe Sahn. Time nd gn these men nd wmn strggld nd scrfcd nd wrkd till their hnds wr raw so tht w mght live  bttr lf. They sw America s bggr thn th sum f our ndvdl mbtns; grtr thn ll th dffrncs f brth r wlth r faction. This is th jrny w cntn tdy. We rmn th mst prsprs, pwrfl ntn on Earth. Our wrkrs are no lss prdctv thn whn ths crisis began. Our mnds are no lss nvntv, our gds nd srvcs no lss needed thn thy wr last wk r last mnth r last yr. Our cpcty rmns ndmnshd. But our tm f stndng pat, f prtctng nrrw ntrsts nd pttng ff nplsnt dcsns--tht tm hs srly pssd. Starting tdy, w must pck rslvs p, dst rslvs ff, nd bgn gn th wrk f rmkng America. For vrywhr w look, thr is wrk t b dn. The stt f our cnmy clls fr ctn, bold nd swft, nd w will act--nt nly t crt new jbs, bt t ly  new fndtn fr grwth. We will bld th rds nd brdgs, th lctrc grids nd dgtl lns tht feed our cmmrc nd bind us tgthr. We will rstr scnc t ts rghtfl plc, nd wield tchnlgy's wndrs t rs hlth cr's qlty nd lwr ts cst. We will hrnss th sun nd th winds nd th soil t fuel our cars nd rn our factories. And w will trnsfrm our schls nd colleges nd nvrsts t mt th dmnds f  new age. All ths w cn do. All ths w will do. Now, thr are some wh qstn th scale f our mbtns--wh sggst tht our systm cn nt tlrt too mny bg plns. Their mmrs are shrt. For thy hv frgttn wht ths cntry hs lrdy dn; wht free men nd wmn cn chv whn mgntn is jnd t cmmn prps, nd ncssty t crg. What th cyncs fail t ndrstnd is tht th grnd hs shftd bnth thm--tht th stale pltcl rgmnts tht hv cnsmd us fr so lng no lngr pply. The qstn w ask tdy is nt whthr our gvrnmnt is too bg r too smll, bt whthr it wrks--whthr it hlps fmls fnd jbs at  dcnt wg, cr thy cn afford,  rtrmnt tht is dgnfd. Where th nswr is ys, w ntnd t mv frwrd. Where th nswr is no, prgrms will end. And those f us wh manage th pblc's dllrs will b held t ccnt--t spnd wsly, rfrm bd hbts, nd do our bsnss in th lght f dy--bcs nly then cn w rstr th vtl trst btwn  ppl nd their gvrnmnt. Nor is th qstn bfr us whthr th mrkt is  frc fr gd r ill. Its pwr t gnrt wlth nd xpnd frdm is nmtchd, bt ths crisis hs rmndd us tht wtht  wtchfl eye, th mrkt cn spn out f cntrl--th ntn cn nt prspr lng whn it fvrs nly th prsprs. The sccss f our cnmy hs lwys dpndd nt jst on th sz f our Gross Domestic Product, bt on th rch f our prsprty; on th blty t xtnd pprtnty t vry wllng hrt--nt out f chrty, bt bcs it is th srst route t our cmmn gd. As fr our cmmn dfns, w rjct s false th chc btwn our sfty nd our ideals. Our Founding Fathers, fcd wth perils tht w cn scrcly mgn, drftd  chrtr t ssr th rule f lw nd th rghts f man,  chrtr xpndd by th blood f gnrtns. Those ideals stll lght th wrld, nd w will nt gv thm p fr xpdnc's sake. And so t ll th other peoples nd gvrnmnts wh are wtchng tdy, frm th grndst cptls t th smll vllg whr my fthr ws born: knw tht America is  frnd f ch ntn nd vry man, woman, nd chld wh sks  ftr f peace nd dgnty, nd w are rdy t lead nc mr. Recall tht rlr gnrtns fcd dwn fscsm nd cmmnsm nt jst wth mssls nd tnks, bt wth th sturdy llncs nd ndrng cnvctns. They ndrstd tht our pwr ln cn nt prtct us, nr ds it nttl us t do s w please. Instead, thy knew tht our pwr grws thrgh ts prdnt use; our scrty emanates frm th jstnss f our cause, th frc f our xmpl, th tempering qlts f hmlty nd rstrnt. We are th kprs f ths lgcy. Guided by these prncpls nc mr, w cn mt those new threats tht dmnd vn grtr ffrt--vn grtr cprtn nd ndrstndng btwn ntns. We will bgn t rspnsbly lv Iraq t ts ppl, nd frg  hard-earned peace in Afghanistan. With old frnds nd frmr foes, w will wrk trlssly t lessen th nuclear thrt, nd rll bck th spctr f  wrmng planet. We will nt plgz fr our wy f lf, nr will w waver in ts dfns, nd fr those wh sk t dvnc their ms by ndcng trrr nd slghtrng nncnts, w sy t y nw tht our spirit is strngr nd cn nt b brkn; y cn nt tlst us, nd w will dft y. For w knw tht our ptchwrk hrtg is  strngth, nt  wknss. We are  ntn f Christians nd Muslims, Jews nd Hindus--nd non-believers. We are shpd by vry lngg nd cltr, drwn frm vry end f ths Earth; nd bcs w hv tasted th bitter swill f cvl war nd sgrgtn, nd mrgd frm tht drk chptr strngr nd mr ntd, w cn nt hlp bt blv tht th old htrds shll smdy pss; tht th lns f trb shll soon dsslv; tht s th wrld grws smllr, our cmmn hmnty shll rvl tslf; nd tht America must ply ts role in ushering in  new era f peace. To th Muslim wrld, w sk  new wy frwrd, bsd on mtl ntrst nd mtl rspct. To those ldrs rnd th glb wh sk t sow cnflct, r blm their scty's ills on th West--knw tht your ppl will jdg y on wht y cn bld, nt wht y dstry. To those wh cling t pwr thrgh crrptn nd deceit nd th slncng f dssnt, knw tht y are on th wrng side f hstry; bt tht w will xtnd  hnd if y are wllng t nclnch your fist. To th ppl f pr ntns, w pldg t wrk lngsd y t mk your farms flrsh nd let cln wtrs flw; t nrsh strvd bds nd feed hngry mnds. And t those ntns lk ours tht njy rltv plnty, w sy w cn no lngr afford ndffrnc t th sffrng tsd our brdrs; nr cn w cnsm th wrld's rsrcs wtht rgrd t ffct. For th wrld hs chngd, nd w must chng wth it. As w cnsdr th road tht nflds bfr us, w rmmbr wth hmbl grttd those brv Americans wh, at ths very hour, ptrl far-off dsrts nd dstnt mountains. They hv smthng t tll us, jst s th flln heroes wh l in Arlington whspr thrgh th ages. We hnr thm nt nly bcs thy are th guardians f our lbrty, bt bcs thy mbdy th spirit f srvc;  wllngnss t fnd mnng in smthng grtr thn thmslvs. And yt, at ths mmnt-- mmnt tht will dfn  gnrtn--it is prcsly ths spirit tht must inhabit us ll. For s mch s gvrnmnt cn do nd must do, it is ltmtly th fth nd dtrmntn f th American ppl pn whch ths ntn relies. It is th kndnss t tk in  stranger whn th levees brk, th slflssnss f wrkrs wh wld rthr ct their hrs thn see  frnd lose their jb whch sees us thrgh our drkst hrs. It is th frfghtr's crg t storm  strwy flld wth smk, bt ls  prnt's wllngnss t nrtr  chld, tht fnlly decides our fate. Our chllngs my b new. The nstrmnts wth whch w mt thm my b new. But those vls pn whch our sccss dpnds--hnsty nd hrd wrk, crg nd fair ply, tlrnc nd crsty, lylty nd ptrtsm--these thngs are old. These thngs are tr. They hv bn th quiet frc f prgrss thrght our hstry. What is dmndd then is  rtrn t these trths. What is rqrd f us nw is  new era f rspnsblty-- rcgntn, on th prt f vry American, tht w hv dts t rslvs, our ntn, nd th wrld, dts tht w do nt grdgngly ccpt bt rthr seize gldly, firm in th knwldg tht thr is nthng so stsfyng t th spirit, so dfnng f our chrctr, thn gvng our ll t  dffclt tsk. This is th prc nd th prms f ctznshp. This is th src f our cnfdnc--th knwldg tht God clls on us t shp an ncrtn dstny. This is th mnng f our lbrty nd our creed--why men nd wmn nd chldrn f vry rc nd vry fth cn jn in clbrtn crss ths mgnfcnt mall, nd why  man whs fthr lss thn sxty yrs g mght nt hv bn srvd at  lcl restaurant cn nw stnd bfr y t tk  mst sacred oath. So let us mrk ths dy wth rmmbrnc, f wh w are nd hw far w hv trvld. In th yr f America's brth, in th cldst f mnths,  smll band f ptrts hddld by dyng cmpfrs on th shores f an cy rvr. The cptl ws bndnd. The nmy ws dvncng. The snw ws stained wth blood. At  mmnt whn th tcm f our rvltn ws mst in dbt, th fthr f our ntn rdrd these wrds b rd t th ppl:" Let it b tld t th ftr wrld...tht in th dpth f wntr, whn nthng bt hp nd vrt cld srvv...tht th cty nd th cntry, lrmd at n cmmn dngr, came frth t mt ... it." America! In th fc f our cmmn dangers, in ths wntr f our hrdshp, let us rmmbr these tmlss wrds. With hp nd vrt, let us brv nc mr th cy crrnts, nd endure wht storms my cm. Let it b said by our chldrn's chldrn tht whn w wr tstd w rfsd t let ths jrny end, tht w dd nt trn bck nr dd w falter; nd wth eyes fxd on th hrzn nd God's grace pn us, w crrd frth tht grt gft f frdm nd dlvrd it sfly t ftr gnrtns. Thank y. God blss y. And God blss th United States f America.
