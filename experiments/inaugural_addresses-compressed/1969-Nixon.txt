 Senator Dirksen, Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. Vice President, President Johnson, Vice President Humphrey, my fellow Americans--nd my fellow ctzns f th wrld cmmnty: I ask y t shr wth me tdy th mjsty f ths mmnt. In th rdrly trnsfr f pwr, w clbrt th nty tht kps us free. Each mmnt in hstry is  fleeting tm, precious nd nq. But some stnd out s mmnts f bgnnng, in whch courses are st tht shp dcds r centuries. This cn b sch  mmnt. Forces nw are cnvrgng tht mk pssbl, fr th frst tm, th hp tht mny f man's deepest sprtns cn at last b rlzd. The sprlng pace f chng llws us t cntmplt, wthn our wn lftm, dvncs tht nc wld hv tkn centuries. In thrwng wd th hrzns f spc, w hv dscvrd new hrzns on rth. For th frst tm, bcs th ppl f th wrld wnt peace, nd th ldrs f th wrld are frd f war, th tms are on th side f peace. Eight yrs frm nw America will clbrt ts 200th nnvrsry s  ntn. Within th lftm f mst ppl nw living, mnknd will clbrt tht grt new yr whch cms nly nc in  thsnd yrs--th bgnnng f th thrd mllnnm. What knd f ntn w will b, wht knd f wrld w will live in, whthr w shp th ftr in th mg f our hps, is ours t dtrmn by our ctns nd our chcs. The grtst hnr hstry cn bstw is th title f peacemaker. This hnr nw bckns America--th chnc t hlp lead th wrld at last out f th vlly f trml, nd onto tht hgh grnd f peace tht man hs drmd f snc th dawn f cvlztn. If w sccd, gnrtns t cm will sy f us nw living tht w mstrd our mmnt, tht w hlpd mk th wrld sf fr mnknd. This is our summons t grtnss. I blv th American ppl are rdy t nswr ths cll. The scnd thrd f ths century hs bn  tm f proud chvmnt. We hv md nrms strds in scnc nd ndstry nd grcltr. We hv shrd our wlth mr brdly thn ever. We hv lrnd at last t manage  mdrn cnmy t ssr ts cntnd grwth. We hv gvn frdm new rch, nd w hv begun t mk ts prms rl fr black s wll s fr white. We see th hp f tmrrw in th yth f tdy. I knw America's yth. I blv in thm. We cn b proud tht thy are bttr dctd, mr cmmttd, mr pssntly drvn by cnscnc thn ny gnrtn in our hstry. No ppl hs ever bn so cls t th chvmnt f  jst nd bndnt scty, r so pssssd f th will t chv it. Because our strngths are so grt, w cn afford t appraise our wknsss wth cndr nd t pprch thm wth hp. Standing in ths sm plc  thrd f  century g, Franklin Delano Roosevelt ddrssd  Nation rvgd by dprssn nd grppd in fear. He cld sy in srvyng th Nation's trbls: "They cncrn, thank God, nly mtrl thngs." Our crisis tdy is th rvrs. We hv found rslvs rich in gds, bt ragged in spirit; rchng wth mgnfcnt prcsn fr th moon, bt fllng into raucous discord on rth. We are cght in war, wntng peace. We are torn by dvsn, wntng nty. We see rnd us mpty lvs, wntng flfllmnt. We see tsks tht need dng, wtng fr hnds t do thm. To  crisis f th spirit, w need an nswr f th spirit. To fnd tht nswr, w need nly look wthn rslvs. When w lstn t "th bttr angels f our nature," w fnd tht thy clbrt th smpl thngs, th bsc thngs--sch s gdnss, dcncy, love, kndnss. Greatness cms in smpl trppngs. The smpl thngs are th ns mst needed tdy if w are t srmnt wht dvds us, nd cmnt wht unites us. To lwr our vcs wld b  smpl thng. In these dffclt yrs, America hs sffrd frm  fever f wrds; frm nfltd rhtrc tht prmss mr thn it cn dlvr; frm ngry rhtrc tht fns discontents into htrds; frm bmbstc rhtrc tht postures nstd f prsdng. We cn nt lrn frm n nthr ntl w stop shouting at n nthr--ntl w spk qtly ngh so tht our wrds cn b heard s wll s our vcs. For ts prt, gvrnmnt will lstn. We will strv t lstn in new wys--t th vcs f quiet ngsh, th vcs tht spk wtht wrds, th vcs f th hrt--t th njrd vcs, th nxs vcs, th vcs tht hv despaired f bng heard. Those wh hv bn lft out, w will try t brng in. Those lft bhnd, w will hlp t ctch p. For ll f our ppl, w will st s our gl th dcnt rdr tht mks prgrss pssbl nd our lvs scr. As w rch twrd our hps, our tsk is t bld on wht hs gone bfr--nt trnng away frm th old, bt trnng twrd th new. In ths pst thrd f  century, gvrnmnt hs pssd mr lws, spnt mr money, nttd mr prgrms, thn in ll our prvs hstry. In prsng our gls f fll mplymnt, bttr hsng, xcllnc in dctn; in rbldng our cities nd mprvng our rrl areas; in prtctng our nvrnmnt nd nhncng th qlty f lf--in ll these nd mr, w will nd must pres rgntly frwrd. We shll pln nw fr th dy whn our wlth cn b trnsfrrd frm th dstrctn f war abroad t th rgnt nds f our ppl at home. The American drm ds nt cm t those wh fall asleep. But w are pprchng th lmts f wht gvrnmnt ln cn do. Our grtst need nw is t rch bynd gvrnmnt, nd t nlst th lgns f th cncrnd nd th cmmttd. What hs t b dn, hs t b dn by gvrnmnt nd ppl tgthr r it will nt b dn at ll. The lssn f pst gny is tht wtht th ppl w cn do nthng; wth th ppl w cn do vrythng. To mtch th mgntd f our tsks, w need th nrgs f our ppl--nlstd nt nly in grand ntrprss, bt mr mprtntly in those smll, splndd ffrts tht mk hdlns in th nghbrhd nwsppr nstd f th ntnl jrnl. With these, w cn bld  grt cthdrl f th spirit--ch f us rsng it n stn at  tm, s h rchs out t his nghbr, hlpng, crng, dng. I do nt ffr  lf f nnsprng ease. I do nt cll fr  lf f grm scrfc. I ask y t jn in  hgh dvntr--n s rich s hmnty tslf, nd s xctng s th tms w live in. The ssnc f frdm is tht ch f us shrs in th shpng f his wn dstny. Until h hs bn prt f  cause lrgr thn hmslf, no man is trly whole. The wy t flfllmnt is in th use f our tlnts; w chv nobility in th spirit tht nsprs tht use. As w msr wht cn b dn, w shll prms nly wht w knw w cn prdc, bt s w chrt our gls w shll b lftd by our drms. No man cn b flly free whl his nghbr is nt. To go frwrd at ll is t go frwrd tgthr. This mns black nd white tgthr, s n ntn, nt tw. The lws hv cght p wth our cnscnc. What rmns is t gv lf t wht is in th lw: t nsr at last tht s ll are born ql in dgnty bfr God, ll are born ql in dgnty bfr man. As w lrn t go frwrd tgthr at home, let us ls sk t go frwrd tgthr wth ll mnknd. Let us tk s our gl: whr peace is nknwn, mk it wlcm; whr peace is frgl, mk it strng; whr peace is tmprry, mk it prmnnt. After  prd f cnfrnttn, w are ntrng an era f ngttn. Let ll ntns knw tht drng ths dmnstrtn our lns f cmmnctn will b open. We sk an open wrld--open t ideas, open t th xchng f gds nd ppl-- wrld in whch no ppl, grt r smll, will live in ngry isolation. We cn nt xpct t mk vryn our frnd, bt w cn try t mk no n our nmy. Those wh wld b our dvrsrs, w nvt t  pcfl cmpttn--nt in cnqrng trrtry r xtndng dmnn, bt in nrchng th lf f man. As w xplr th rchs f spc, let us go t th new wrlds tgthr--nt s new wrlds t b cnqrd, bt s  new dvntr t b shrd. With those wh are wllng t jn, let us cprt t rdc th brdn f rms, t strngthn th strctr f peace, t lift p th pr nd th hngry. But t ll those wh wld b tmptd by wknss, let us lv no dbt tht w will b s strng s w need t b fr s lng s w need t b. Over th pst twnty yrs, snc I frst came t ths Capital s  frshmn Congressman, I hv vstd mst f th ntns f th wrld. I hv cm t knw th ldrs f th wrld, nd th grt frcs, th htrds, th frs tht dvd th wrld. I knw tht peace ds nt cm thrgh wshng fr it--tht thr is no sbsttt fr dys nd vn yrs f ptnt nd prlngd dplmcy. I ls knw th ppl f th wrld. I hv sn th hngr f  hmlss chld, th pain f  man wndd in bttl, th grf f  mthr wh hs lost her son. I knw these hv no dlgy, no rc. I knw America. I knw th hrt f America is gd. I spk frm my wn hrt, nd th hrt f my cntry, th dp cncrn w hv fr those wh sffr, nd those wh srrw. I hv tkn an oath tdy in th prsnc f God nd my cntrymn t phld nd dfnd th Constitution f th United States. To tht oath I nw add ths sacred cmmtmnt: I shll cnscrt my ffc, my nrgs, nd ll th wsdm I cn smmn, t th cause f peace mng ntns. Let ths mssg b heard by strng nd weak alike: The peace w sk t win is nt vctry vr ny other ppl, bt th peace tht cms "wth hlng in ts wngs"; wth cmpssn fr those wh hv sffrd; wth ndrstndng fr those wh hv ppsd us; wth th pprtnty fr ll th peoples f ths rth t choose their wn dstny. Only  fw shrt wks g, w shrd th glry f man's frst sight f th wrld s God sees it, s  sngl sphr rflctng lght in th drknss. As th Apollo strnts flew vr th moon's gry srfc on Christmas Eve, thy spoke t us f th bty f rth--nd in tht vc so clr crss th lunar dstnc, w heard thm nvk God's blssng on ts gdnss. In tht mmnt, their vw frm th moon mvd poet Archibald MacLeish t wrt:" To see th rth s it trly is, smll nd blue nd btfl in tht trnl slnc whr it floats, is t see rslvs s riders on th rth tgthr, brthrs on tht bright loveliness in th trnl cold--brthrs wh knw nw thy are trly brthrs." In tht mmnt f srpssng tchnlgcl trmph, men trnd their thghts twrd home nd hmnty--sng in tht far prspctv tht man's dstny on rth is nt divisible; tllng us tht hwvr far w rch into th csms, our dstny lies nt in th stars bt on Earth tslf, in our wn hnds, in our wn hrts. We hv ndrd  lng nght f th American spirit. But s our eyes ctch th dmnss f th frst rys f dawn, let us nt curse th rmnng drk. Let us gthr th lght. Our dstny ffrs, nt th cup f dspr, bt th chlc f pprtnty. So let us seize it, nt in fear, bt in gldnss--nd, "riders on th rth tgthr," let us go frwrd, firm in our fth, stdfst in our prps, cautious f th dangers; bt sstnd by our cnfdnc in th will f God nd th prms f man.
