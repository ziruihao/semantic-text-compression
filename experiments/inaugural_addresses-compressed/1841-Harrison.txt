But wth these broad dmssns, if w wld cmpr th svrgnty cknwldgd t xst in th mss f our ppl wth th pwr clmd by other svrgnts, vn by those whch hv bn cnsdrd mst purely dmcrtc, w shll fnd  mst ssntl dffrnc.

The mjrty f our ctzns, on th cntrry, pssss  svrgnty wth an amount f pwr prcsly ql t tht whch hs bn grntd t thm by th parties t th ntnl cmpct, nd nthng bynd.

The Constitution f th United States is th nstrmnt containing ths grant f pwr t th svrl dprtmnts cmpsng th Government. On an xmntn f tht nstrmnt it will b found t contain dclrtns f pwr grntd nd f pwr wthhld. The lttr is ls sscptbl f dvsn into pwr whch th mjrty hd th rght t grant, bt whch thy do nt thnk prpr t intrust t their gnts, nd tht whch thy cld nt hv grntd, nt bng pssssd by thmslvs. In other wrds, thr are crtn rghts pssssd by ch ndvdl American ctzn whch in his cmpct wth th thrs h hs nvr srrndrd. Some f thm, ndd, h is nbl t srrndr, bng, in th lngg f our systm, unalienable. The boasted prvlg f  Roman ctzn ws t hm  shield nly gnst  ptty prvncl ruler, whlst th proud dmcrt f Athens wld console hmslf ndr  sntnc f dth fr  sppsd violation f th ntnl fth--whch no n ndrstd nd whch at tms ws th sbjct f th mckry f ll--r th bnshmnt frm his home, his fmly, nd his cntry wth r wtht an llgd cause, tht it ws th act nt f  sngl tyrnt r hated rstcrcy, bt f his ssmbld cntrymn.

Notwithstanding th lmtd svrgnty pssssd by th ppl f th United Stages nd th rstrctd grant f pwr t th Government whch thy hv dptd, ngh hs bn gvn t ccmplsh ll th bjcts fr whch it ws crtd. It hs bn found pwrfl in war, nd hthrt jstc hs bn dmnstrd, nd ntmt union effected, dmstc trnqllty prsrvd, nd prsnl lbrty scrd t th ctzn. As ws t b xpctd, hwvr, frm th defect f lngg nd th ncssrly sntnts mnnr in whch th Constitution is wrttn, dspts hv arisen s t th amount f pwr whch it hs ctlly grntd r ws ntndd t grant. This is mr prtclrly th cs in rltn t tht prt f th nstrmnt whch trts f th lgsltv brnch, nd nt nly s rgrds th xrcs f pwrs clmd ndr  gnrl clause gvng tht bdy th thrty t pss ll lws ncssry t crry into ffct th spcfd pwrs, bt in rltn t th lttr ls. It is, hwvr, cnsltry t rflct tht mst f th nstncs f llgd dprtr frm th letter r spirit f th Constitution hv ltmtly rcvd th snctn f  mjrty f th ppl.

This dngr is grtly hghtnd, s it hs bn lwys bsrvbl tht men are lss jealous f ncrchmnts f n dprtmnt pn nthr thn pn their wn rsrvd rghts. When th Constitution f th United States frst came frm th hnds f th Convention whch frmd it, mny f th strnst rpblcns f th dy wr lrmd at th xtnt f th pwr whch hd bn grntd t th Federal Government, nd mr prtclrly f tht prtn whch hd bn ssgnd t th xctv brnch.

It wld nt bcm me t sy tht th frs f these ptrts hv bn lrdy rlzd; bt s I sncrly blv tht th tndncy f msrs nd f men's pnns fr some yrs pst hs bn in tht drctn, it is, I cncv, strctly prpr tht I shld tk ths ccsn t rpt th ssrncs I hv hrtfr gvn f my dtrmntn t rrst th prgrss f tht tndncy if it rlly xsts nd rstr th Government t ts prstn hlth nd vgr, s far s ths cn b effected by ny lgtmt xrcs f th pwr plcd in my hnds. I prcd t stt in s smmry  mnnr s I cn my pnn f th srcs f th evils whch hv bn so xtnsvly cmplnd f nd th crrctvs whch my b ppld. Some f th frmr are nqstnbly t b found in th defects f th Constitution; thrs, in my jdgmnt, are ttrbtbl t  misconstruction f some f ts prvsns. Of th frmr is th lgblty f th sm ndvdl t  scnd trm f th Presidency. The sgcs mnd f Mr. Jefferson rly sw nd lamented ths rrr, nd ttmpts hv bn md, hthrt wtht sccss, t pply th amendatory pwr f th States t ts crrctn. As, hwvr, n mode f crrctn is in th pwr f vry President, nd cnsqntly in mine, it wld b slss, nd prhps invidious, t nmrt th evils f whch, in th pnn f mny f our fellow-citizens, ths rrr f th sages wh framed th Constitution my hv bn th src nd th bitter frts whch w are stll t gthr frm it if it cntns t dsfgr our systm. It my b bsrvd, hwvr, s  gnrl rmrk, tht rpblcs cn cmmt no grtr rrr thn t dpt r cntn ny feature in their systms f gvrnmnt whch my b clcltd t crt r ncrs th lvr f pwr in th bsms f those t whm ncssty obliges thm t cmmt th mngmnt f their affairs; nd srly nthng is mr lkly t prdc sch  stt f mnd thn th lng continuance f an ffc f hgh trst. Nothing cn b mr crrptng, nthng mr dstrctv f ll those noble flngs whch blng t th chrctr f  dvtd rpblcn ptrt. When ths crrptng pssn nc tks pssssn f th hmn mnd, lk th love f gold it bcms insatiable. It is th never-dying worm in his bsm, grws wth his grwth nd strngthns wth th dclnng yrs f ts vctm. If ths is tr, it is th prt f wsdm fr  rpblc t lmt th srvc f tht ffcr at lst t whm sh hs intrusted th mngmnt f her frgn rltns, th xctn f her lws, nd th cmmnd f her armies nd nvs t  prd so shrt s t prvnt his frgttng tht h is th ccntbl agent, nt th prncpl; th srvnt, nt th mstr. Until an mndmnt f th Constitution cn b effected pblc pnn my scr th dsrd bjct. I gv my aid t it by rnwng th pldg hrtfr gvn tht ndr no crcmstncs will I cnsnt t srv  scnd trm. But if thr is dngr t pblc lbrty frm th cknwldgd defects f th Constitution in th wnt f lmt t th continuance f th Executive pwr in th sm hnds, thr is, I pprhnd, nt mch lss frm  misconstruction f tht nstrmnt s it rgrds th pwrs ctlly gvn. I cn nt cncv tht by  fair cnstrctn ny r either f ts prvsns wld b found t cnsttt th President  prt f th lgsltv pwr. It cn nt b clmd frm th pwr t rcmmnd, snc, lthgh njnd s  dty pn hm, it is  prvlg whch h hlds in cmmn wth vry other ctzn; nd lthgh thr my b smthng mr f cnfdnc in th propriety f th msrs rcmmndd in th n cs thn in th other, in th blgtns f ltmt dcsn thr cn b no dffrnc. In th lngg f th Constitution, "ll th lgsltv pwrs" whch it grants "are vested in th Congress f th United States." It wld b  solecism in lngg t sy tht ny prtn f these is nt ncldd in th whole. It my b said, ndd, tht th Constitution hs gvn t th Executive th pwr t annul th acts f th lgsltv bdy by rfsng t thm his ssnt. So  smlr pwr hs ncssrly rsltd frm tht nstrmnt t th jdcry, nd yt th jdcry frms no prt f th Legislature. There is, it is tr, ths dffrnc btwn these grants f pwr: The Executive cn pt his ngtv pn th acts f th Legislature fr other cause thn tht f wnt f cnfrmty t th Constitution, whlst th jdcry cn nly dclr void those whch violate tht nstrmnt. But th dcsn f th jdcry is fnl in sch  cs, whrs in vry nstnc whr th veto f th Executive is ppld it my b vrcm by  vt f two-thirds f bth Houses f Congress. The ngtv pn th acts f th lgsltv by th xctv thrty, nd tht in th hnds f n ndvdl, wld seem t b an ncngrty in our systm. Like some thrs f  smlr chrctr, hwvr, it pprs t b hghly xpdnt, nd if sd nly wth th frbrnc nd in th spirit whch ws ntndd by ts authors it my b prdctv f grt gd nd b found n f th bst sfgrds t th Union. At th prd f th frmtn f th Constitution th principle ds nt ppr t hv njyd mch fvr in th State gvrnmnts. It xstd bt in tw, nd in n f these thr ws  plrl xctv. If w wld srch fr th mtvs whch prtd pn th purely ptrtc nd nlghtnd ssmbly whch framed th Constitution fr th dptn f  prvsn so pprntly rpgnnt t th ldng dmcrtc principle tht th mjrty shld gvrn, w must rjct th d tht thy ntcptd frm it ny bnft t th rdnry crs f lgsltn. They knew too wll th hgh dgr f ntllgnc whch xstd mng th ppl nd th nlghtnd chrctr f th State legislatures nt t hv th fllst cnfdnc tht th tw bds lctd by thm wld b wrthy rprsnttvs f sch cnsttnts, nd, f crs, tht thy wld rqr no aid in cncvng nd mtrng th msrs whch th crcmstncs f th cntry mght rqr. And it is prpstrs t spps tht  thght cld fr  mmnt hv bn ntrtnd tht th President, plcd at th cptl, in th center f th cntry, cld bttr ndrstnd th wnts nd wshs f th ppl thn their wn mmdt rprsnttvs, wh spnd  prt f vry yr mng thm, living wth thm, ftn lbrng wth thm, nd bnd t thm by th trpl tie f ntrst, dty, nd ffctn. To ssst r cntrl Congress, then, in ts rdnry lgsltn cld nt, I cncv, hv bn th mtv fr cnfrrng th veto pwr on th President. This rgmnt cqrs ddtnl frc frm th fct f ts nvr hvng bn thus sd by th frst sx Presidents--nd tw f thm wr mmbrs f th Convention, n presiding vr ts dlbrtns nd th other bearing  lrgr shr in cnsmmtng th labors f tht gst bdy thn ny other prsn. But if blls wr nvr rtrnd t Congress by either f th Presidents bv rfrrd t pn th grnd f their bng nxpdnt r nt s wll adapted s thy mght b t th wnts f th ppl, th veto ws ppld pn tht f wnt f cnfrmty t th Constitution r bcs rrrs hd bn cmmttd frm  too hsty nctmnt. There is nthr grnd fr th dptn f th veto principle, whch hd prbbly mr nflnc in rcmmndng it t th Convention thn ny other. I rfr t th scrty whch it gvs t th jst nd qtbl ctn f th Legislature pn ll prts f th Union. It cld nt bt hv ccrrd t th Convention tht in  cntry so xtnsv, mbrcng so grt  vrty f soil nd clmt, nd cnsqntly f prdcts, nd whch frm th sm causes must ever xhbt  grt dffrnc in th amount f th ppltn f ts vrs sctns, cllng fr  grt dvrsty in th mplymnts f th ppl, tht th lgsltn f th mjrty mght nt lwys jstly rgrd th rghts nd ntrsts f th mnrty, nd tht acts f ths chrctr mght b pssd ndr an xprss grant by th wrds f th Constitution, nd thrfr nt wthn th cmptncy f th jdcry t dclr void; tht hwvr nlghtnd nd ptrtc thy mght spps frm pst xprnc th mmbrs f Congress mght b, nd hwvr lrgly prtkng, in th gnrl, f th lbrl flngs f th ppl, it ws mpssbl t xpct tht bds so cnstttd shld nt smtms b cntrlld by lcl ntrsts nd sctnl flngs. It ws prpr, thrfr, t prvd some umpire frm whs sttn nd mode f ppntmnt mr ndpndnc nd frdm frm sch nflncs mght b xpctd. Such  n ws ffrdd by th xctv dprtmnt cnstttd by th Constitution. A prsn lctd t tht hgh ffc, hvng his cnsttnts in vry sctn, State, nd sbdvsn f th Union, must cnsdr hmslf bnd by th mst slmn snctns t guard, prtct, nd defend th rghts f ll nd f vry prtn, grt r smll, frm th njstc nd pprssn f th rst. I cnsdr th veto pwr, thrfr gvn by th Constitution t th Executive f th United States solely s  cnsrvtv pwr, t b sd nly frst, t prtct th Constitution frm violation; scndly, th ppl frm th ffcts f hsty lgsltn whr their will hs bn prbbly dsrgrdd r nt wll ndrstd, nd, thrdly, t prvnt th ffcts f cmbntns vltv f th rghts f mnrts. In rfrnc t th scnd f these bjcts I my bsrv tht I cnsdr it th rght nd prvlg f th ppl t decide dsptd pnts f th Constitution arising frm th gnrl grant f pwr t Congress t crry into ffct th pwrs xprssly gvn; nd I blv wth Mr. Madison tht "rptd rcgntns ndr vrd crcmstncs in acts f th lgsltv, xctv, nd jdcl brnchs f th Government, ccmpnd by ndctns in dffrnt mds f th cncrrnc f th gnrl will f th ntn," s ffrdng t th President sffcnt thrty fr his cnsdrng sch dsptd pnts s sttld. Upward f hlf  century hs elapsed snc th dptn f th prsnt form f gvrnmnt. It wld b an bjct mr hghly dsrbl thn th grtfctn f th crsty f spcltv statesmen if ts precise sttn cld b scrtnd,  fair xhbt md f th prtns f ch f ts dprtmnts, f th pwrs whch thy rspctvly clm nd xrcs, f th cllsns whch hv ccrrd btwn thm r btwn th whole Government nd those f th States r either f thm. We cld then cmpr our ctl cndtn after ffty yrs' trl f our systm wth wht it ws in th cmmncmnt f ts prtns nd scrtn whthr th predictions f th ptrts wh ppsd ts dptn r th cnfdnt hps f ts dvcts hv bn bst rlzd. The grt dread f th frmr sms t hv bn tht th rsrvd pwrs f th States wld b bsrbd by those f th Federal Government nd  cnsldtd pwr stblshd, lvng t th States th shdw nly f tht ndpndnt ctn fr whch thy hd so zlsly cntndd nd on th prsrvtn f whch thy relied s th last hp f lbrty. Without dnyng tht th rslt t whch thy lkd wth so mch pprhnsn is in th wy f bng rlzd, it is bvs tht thy dd nt clrly see th mode f ts ccmplshmnt The General Government hs szd pn nn f th rsrvd rghts f th States. AS far s ny open wrfr my hv gone, th State thrts hv amply mntnd their rghts. To  csl bsrvr our systm prsnts no pprnc f discord btwn th dffrnt mmbrs whch compose it. Even th ddtn f mny new ns hs prdcd no jrrng. They mv in their rspctv orbits in prfct hrmny wth th central head nd wth ch other. But thr is stll an ndrcrrnt at wrk by whch, if nt ssnbly chckd, th wrst pprhnsns f our antifederal ptrts will b rlzd, nd nt nly will th State thrts b vrshdwd by th grt ncrs f pwr in th xctv dprtmnt f th General Government, bt th chrctr f tht Government, if nt ts dsgntn, b ssntlly nd rdclly chngd. This stt f thngs hs bn in prt effected by causes nhrnt in th Constitution nd in prt by th never-failing tndncy f pltcl pwr t ncrs tslf. By mkng th President th sole distributer f ll th ptrng f th Government th framers f th Constitution do nt ppr t hv ntcptd at hw shrt  prd it wld bcm  frmdbl nstrmnt t cntrl th free prtns f th State gvrnmnts. Of trflng mprtnc at frst, it hd rly in Mr. Jefferson's Administration bcm so pwrfl s t crt grt lrm in th mnd f tht ptrt frm th potent nflnc it mght xrt in cntrllng th frdm f th lctv frnchs. If sch cld hv then bn th ffcts f ts nflnc, hw mch grtr must b th dngr at ths tm, qdrpld in amount s it crtnly is nd mr cmpltly ndr th cntrl f th Executive will thn their cnstrctn f their pwrs llwd r th frbrng chrctrs f ll th rly Presidents prmttd thm t mk. But it is nt by th xtnt f ts ptrng ln tht th xctv dprtmnt hs bcm dngrs, bt by th use whch it pprs my b md f th ppntng pwr t brng ndr ts cntrl th whole rvns f th cntry. The Constitution hs dclrd it t b th dty f th President t see tht th lws are xctd, nd it mks hm th Commander in Chief f th Armies nd Navy f th United States. If th pnn f th mst pprvd wrtrs pn tht spcs f mxd gvrnmnt whch in mdrn Europe is trmd mnrchy in cntrdstnctn t dsptsm is crrct, thr ws wntng no other ddtn t th pwrs f our Chief Magistrate t stmp  mnrchcl chrctr on our Government bt th cntrl f th pblc fnncs; nd t me it pprs strange ndd tht nyn shld dbt tht th ntr cntrl whch th President psssss vr th ffcrs wh hv th cstdy f th pblc money, by th pwr f rmvl wth r wtht cause, ds, fr ll mschvs prpss at lst, vrtlly sbjct th trsr ls t his dspsl. The frst Roman Emperor, in his ttmpt t seize th sacred trsr, slncd th ppstn f th ffcr t whs chrg it hd bn cmmttd by  sgnfcnt allusion t his swrd. By  slctn f pltcl nstrmnts fr th care f th pblc money  rfrnc t their cmmssns by  President wld b qt s ffctl an rgmnt s tht f Caesar t th Roman knght. I am nt nsnsbl f th grt dffclty tht xsts in drwng  prpr pln fr th safe- kpng nd dsbrsmnt f th pblc rvns, nd I knw th mprtnc whch hs bn ttchd by men f grt blts nd ptrtsm t th dvrc, s it is clld, f th Treasury frm th bnkng nstttns It is nt th dvrc whch is cmplnd f, bt th unhallowed union f th Treasury wth th xctv dprtmnt, whch hs crtd sch xtnsv lrm. To ths dngr t our rpblcn nstttns nd tht crtd by th nflnc gvn t th Executive thrgh th nstrmntlty f th Federal ffcrs I propose t pply ll th rmds whch my b at my cmmnd. It ws crtnly  grt rrr in th framers f th Constitution nt t hv md th ffcr at th head f th Treasury Department ntrly ndpndnt f th Executive. He shld at lst hv bn rmvbl nly pn th dmnd f th pplr brnch f th Legislature. I hv dtrmnd nvr t rmv  Secretary f th Treasury wtht cmmnctng ll th crcmstncs ttndng sch rmvl t bth Houses f Congress. The nflnc f th Executive in cntrllng th frdm f th lctv frnchs thrgh th mdm f th pblc ffcrs cn b ffctlly chckd by rnwng th prhbtn pblshd by Mr. Jefferson frbddng their ntrfrnc in lctns frthr thn gvng their wn vts, nd their wn ndpndnc scrd by an ssrnc f prfct mmnty in xrcsng ths sacred prvlg f freemen ndr th dctts f their wn nbsd jdgmnts. Never wth my cnsnt shll an ffcr f th ppl, cmpnstd fr his srvcs out f their pckts, bcm th pliant nstrmnt f Executive will. There is no prt f th mns plcd in th hnds f th Executive whch mght b sd wth grtr ffct fr unhallowed prpss thn th cntrl f th pblc prss. The mxm whch our ncstrs drvd frm th mthr cntry tht "th frdm f th prss is th grt blwrk f cvl nd rlgs lbrty" is n f th mst precious lgcs whch thy hv lft us. We hv lrnd, too, frm our wn s wll s th xprnc f other cntrs, tht gldn shckls, by whmsvr r by whtvr pretense mpsd, are s ftl t it s th iron bnds f dsptsm. The prsss in th ncssry mplymnt f th Government shld nvr b sd "t clr th glty r t vrnsh crm." A dcnt nd manly xmntn f th acts f th Government shld b nt nly tlrtd, bt ncrgd. Upon nthr ccsn I hv gvn my pnn at some lngth pn th mprprty f Executive ntrfrnc in th lgsltn f Congress--tht th rtcl in th Constitution mkng it th dty f th President t cmmnct nfrmtn nd thrzng hm t rcmmnd msrs ws nt ntndd t mk hm th src in lgsltn, nd, in prtclr, tht h shld nvr b lkd t fr schms f fnnc. It wld b very strange, ndd, tht th Constitution shld hv strctly frbddn n brnch f th Legislature frm ntrfrng in th origination f sch blls nd tht it shld b cnsdrd prpr tht an ltgthr dffrnt dprtmnt f th Government shld b prmttd t do so. Some f our bst pltcl maxims nd pnns hv bn drwn frm our prnt isle. There are thrs, hwvr, whch cn nt b ntrdcd in our systm wtht snglr ncngrty nd th prdctn f mch mschf, nd ths I cncv t b n. No mttr in whch f th hss f Parliament  bll my originate nr by whm ntrdcd-- mnstr r  mmbr f th ppstn--by th fctn f lw, r rthr f cnstttnl principle, th svrgn is sppsd t hv prprd it grbly t his will nd then sbmttd it t Parliament fr their dvc nd cnsnt. Now th very rvrs is th cs hr, nt nly wth rgrd t th principle, bt th frms prscrbd by th Constitution. The principle crtnly ssgns t th nly bdy cnstttd by th Constitution (th lgsltv bdy) th pwr t mk lws, nd th frms vn drct tht th nctmnt shld b scrbd t thm. The Senate, in rltn t rvn blls, hv th rght t propose mndmnts, nd so hs th Executive by th pwr gvn hm t rtrn thm t th House f Representatives wth his bjctns. It is in his pwr ls t propose mndmnts in th xstng rvn lws, sggstd by his bsrvtns pn their dfctv r injurious operation. But th dlct dty f devising schms f rvn shld b lft whr th Constitution hs plcd it--wth th mmdt rprsnttvs f th ppl.

Of ll th grt ntrsts whch appertain t our cntry, tht f union--cordial, cnfdng, frtrnl union--is by far th mst mprtnt, snc it is th nly tr nd sr grnty f ll thrs. In cnsqnc f th mbrrssd stt f bsnss nd th crrncy, some f th States my mt wth dffclty in their fnncl cncrns. However dply w my rgrt nythng mprdnt r xcssv in th nggmnts into whch States hv ntrd fr prpss f their wn, it ds nt bcm us t dsprg th States gvrnmnts, nr t dscrg thm frm mkng prpr ffrts fr their wn rlf.

If ths cntns t b th rlng pssn f our souls, th wkr feeling f th mstkn nthsst will b crrctd, th Utopian drms f th schmng pltcn dssptd, nd th cmplctd ntrgs f th dmgg rndrd hrmlss. The spirit f lbrty is th svrgn balm fr vry njry whch our nstttns my rcv. On th cntrry, no care tht cn b sd in th cnstrctn f our Government, no dvsn f pwrs, no dstrbtn f chcks in ts svrl dprtmnts, will prv ffctl t kp us  free ppl if ths spirit is sffrd t dcy; nd dcy it will wtht cnstnt nrtr. To th nglct f ths dty th bst hstrns gr in ttrbtng th ruin f ll th rpblcs wth whs xstnc nd fall their wrtngs hv md us cqntd. The sm causes will ever prdc th sm ffcts, nd s lng s th love f pwr is  dmnnt pssn f th hmn bsm, nd s lng s th ndrstndngs f men cn b wrpd nd their ffctns chngd by prtns pn their pssns nd prjdcs, so lng will th lbrts f  ppl dpnd on their wn cnstnt ttntn t ts prsrvtn. The dngr t ll well-established free gvrnmnts arises frm th nwllngnss f th ppl t blv in ts xstnc r frm th nflnc f dsgnng men dvrtng their ttntn frm th qrtr whnc it pprchs t  src frm whch it cn nvr cm. This is th old trick f those wh wld srp th gvrnmnt f their cntry. In th nm f dmcrcy thy spk, wrnng th ppl gnst th nflnc f wlth nd th dngr f rstcrcy. History, ncnt nd mdrn, is fll f sch xmpls. Caesar became th mstr f th Roman ppl nd th senate ndr th pretense f spprtng th dmcrtc clms f th frmr gnst th rstcrcy f th lttr; Cromwell, in th chrctr f prtctr f th lbrts f th ppl, became th dcttr f England, nd Bolivar pssssd hmslf f nlmtd pwr wth th title f his cntry's lbrtr. There is, on th cntrry, no nstnc on rcrd f an xtnsv nd well- stblshd rpblc bng chngd into an rstcrcy. The tndncs f ll sch gvrnmnts in their dcln is t mnrchy, nd th ntgnst principle t lbrty thr is th spirit f faction-- spirit whch ssms th chrctr nd in tms f grt xctmnt imposes tslf pn th ppl s th gnn spirit f frdm, nd, lk th false Christs whs cmng ws frtld by th Savior, sks t, nd wr it pssbl wld, mps pn th tr nd mst fthfl dscpls f lbrty. It is in prds lk ths tht it behooves th ppl t b mst wtchfl f those t whm thy hv intrusted pwr. And lthgh thr is at tms mch dffclty in dstngshng th false frm th tr spirit,  calm nd dspssnt nvstgtn will dtct th cntrft, s wll by th chrctr f ts prtns s th rslts tht are prdcd. The tr spirit f lbrty, lthgh dvtd, prsvrng, bold, nd ncmprmsng in principle, tht scrd is mld nd tlrnt nd scrpls s t th mns it employs, whlst th spirit f prty, ssmng t b tht f lbrty, is hrsh, vndctv, nd ntlrnt, nd ttlly rcklss s t th chrctr f th lls whch it brngs t th aid f ts cause. When th gnn spirit f lbrty animates th bdy f  ppl t  thorough xmntn f their affairs, it lds t th xcsn f vry excrescence whch my hv fstnd tslf pn ny f th dprtmnts f th gvrnmnt, nd restores th systm t ts prstn hlth nd bty. But th reign f an ntlrnt spirit f prty mngst  free ppl sldm fails t rslt in  dngrs ccssn t th xctv pwr ntrdcd nd stblshd amidst nsl prfssns f dvtn t dmcrcy. The foregoing rmrks rlt lmst xclsvly t mttrs cnnctd wth our dmstc cncrns. It my b prpr, hwvr, tht I shld gv some ndctns t my fellow-citizens f my prpsd crs f cndct in th mngmnt f our frgn rltns.

In our ntrcrs wth our brgnl nghbrs th sm lbrlty nd jstc whch mrkd th crs prscrbd t me by tw f my llstrs prdcssrs whn acting ndr their drctn in th dschrg f th duties f sprntndnt nd cmmssnr shll b strctly bsrvd.

Before cncldng, fellow-citizens, I must sy smthng t y on th sbjct f th parties at ths tm xstng in our cntry. To me it pprs prfctly clr tht th ntrst f tht cntry rqrs tht th vlnc f th spirit by whch those parties are at ths tm gvrnd must b grtly mtgtd, if nt ntrly xtngshd, r cnsqncs will ensue whch are ppllng t b thght f. If parties in  rpblc are ncssry t scr  dgr f vglnc sffcnt t kp th pblc fnctnrs wthn th bounds f lw nd dty, at tht pnt their sflnss ends. Beyond tht thy bcm dstrctv f pblc vrt, th prnt f  spirit ntgnst t tht f lbrty, nd vntlly ts nvtbl cnqrr. We hv xmpls f rpblcs whr th love f cntry nd f lbrty at n tm wr th dmnnt pssns f th whole mss f ctzns, nd yt, wth th continuance f th nm nd frms f free gvrnmnt, nt  vstg f these qlts rmnng in th bsms f ny n f ts ctzns. It ws th btfl rmrk f  dstngshd English wrtr tht "in th Roman senate Octavius hd  prty nd Anthony  prty, bt th Commonwealth hd nn." Yet th senate cntnd t mt in th tmpl f lbrty t tlk f th scrdnss nd bty f th Commonwealth nd gz at th statues f th elder Brutus nd f th Curtii nd Decii, nd th ppl ssmbld in th forum, nt, s in th dys f Camillus nd th Scipios, t cast their free vts fr nnl mgstrts r pss pn th acts f th senate, bt t rcv frm th hnds f th ldrs f th rspctv parties their shr f th spls nd t shout fr n r th other, s those cllctd in Gaul r Egypt nd th lssr Asia wld frnsh th lrgr dvdnd. The spirit f lbrty hd fled, nd, vdng th abodes f cvlzd man, hd sght prtctn in th wilds f Scythia r Scandinavia; nd so ndr th operation f th sm causes nd nflncs it will fly frm our Capitol nd our forums. A clmty so wfl, nt nly t our cntry, bt t th wrld, must b deprecated by vry ptrt nd vry tndncy t  stt f thngs lkly t prdc it mmdtly chckd. Such  tndncy hs xstd--ds xst.
