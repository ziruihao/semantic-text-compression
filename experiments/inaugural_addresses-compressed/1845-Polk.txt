 Fellow ctzns, wtht slcttn on my prt, I hv bn chsn by th free nd vlntry sffrgs f my cntrymn t th mst hnrbl nd mst rspnsbl ffc on rth. I am dply mprssd wth grttd fr th cnfdnc rpsd in me.

If th mr aged nd xprncd men wh hv flld th ffc f President f th United States vn in th nfncy f th Republic dstrstd their blty t dschrg th dts f tht xltd station, wht ought nt t b th pprhnsns f n so mch yngr nd lss ndwd nw tht our dmn xtnds frm ocean t ocean, tht our ppl hv so grtly ncrsd in nmbrs, nd at  tm whn so grt dvrsty f pnn prvls in rgrd t th prncpls nd plcy whch shld chrctrz th dmnstrtn f our Government? Well my th boldest fear nd th wsst trmbl whn ncrrng rspnsblts on whch my dpnd our cntry's peace nd prsprty, nd in some dgr th hps nd hppnss f th whole hmn fmly.

With  firm rlnc pn th wsdm f Omnipotence t sstn nd drct me in th pth f dty whch I am ppntd t prs, I stnd in th prsnc f ths ssmbld mlttd f my cntrymn t tk pn myslf th slmn blgtn "t th bst f my blty t prsrv, prtct, nd dfnd th Constitution f th United States." A cncs nmrtn f th prncpls whch will guide me in th dmnstrtv plcy f th Government is nt nly in ccrdnc wth th xmpls st me by ll my prdcssrs, bt is mnntly bfttng th ccsn.

It will b my frst cr t dmnstr th Government in th tr spirit f tht nstrmnt, nd t ssm no pwrs nt xprssly grntd r clrly mpld in ts trms. The Government f th United States is n f dlgtd nd lmtd pwrs, arid it is by  strct dhrnc t th clrly grntd pwrs nd by bstnng frm th xrcs f dbtfl r nthrzd mpld pwrs tht w hv th nly sr grnty gnst th rcrrnc f those nfrtnt cllsns btwn th Federal nd State thrts whch hv ccsnlly so mch dstrbd th hrmny f our systm nd vn thrtnd th prptty f our glrs Union. "To th States, rspctvly, r t th ppl" hv bn rsrvd "th pwrs nt dlgtd t th United States by th Constitution nr prhbtd by it t th States." Each State is  cmplt svrgnty wthn th sphr f ts rsrvd pwrs. The Government f th Union, acting wthn th sphr f ts dlgtd thrty, is ls  cmplt svrgnty. While th General Government shld abstain frm th xrcs f thrty nt clrly dlgtd t it, th States shld b qlly crfl tht in th mntnnc f their rghts thy do nt vrstp th lmts f pwrs rsrvd t thm. One f th mst dstngshd f my prdcssrs ttchd dsrvd mprtnc t "th spprt f th State gvrnmnts in ll their rghts, s th mst cmptnt dmnstrtn fr our dmstc cncrns nd th srst blwrk gnst antirepublican tndncs," nd t th "prsrvtn f th General Government in ts whole cnstttnl vgr, s th sheet nchr f our peace at home nd sfty abroad." To th Government f th United States hs bn intrusted th xclsv mngmnt f our frgn affairs. Beyond tht it wlds  fw gnrl nmrtd pwrs. It ds nt frc rfrm on th States. It leaves ndvdls, vr whm it casts ts prtctng nflnc, ntrly free t mprv their wn cndtn by th lgtmt xrcs f ll their mntl nd physcl pwrs.

And w rjc in th gnrl hppnss, prsprty, nd dvncmnt f our cntry, whch hv bn th ffsprng f frdm, nd nt f pwr. This mst dmrbl nd wsst systm f well-regulated self-government mng men ever devised by hmn mnds hs bn tstd by ts sccssfl operation fr mr thn hlf  century, nd if prsrvd frm th srptns f th Federal Government on th n hnd nd th xrcs by th States f pwrs nt rsrvd t thm on th other, will, I frvntly hp nd blv, endure fr ages t cm nd dspns th blssngs f cvl nd rlgs lbrty t dstnt gnrtns. To ffct bjcts so dear t vry ptrt I shll dvt myslf wth nxs solicitude.

By th thry f our Government mjrts rule, bt ths rght is nt an rbtrry r nlmtd n. It is  rght t b xrcsd in sbrdntn t th Constitution nd in cnfrmty t it. One grt bjct f th Constitution ws t rstrn mjrts frm pprssng mnrts r ncrchng pn their jst rghts. Minorities hv  rght t appeal t th Constitution s  shield gnst sch pprssn. That th blssngs f lbrty whch our Constitution secures my b njyd alike by mnrts nd mjrts, th Executive hs bn wsly nvstd wth  qlfd veto pn th acts f th Legislature.

Like ll other pwrs, it is sbjct t b abused. When jdcsly nd prprly xrcsd, th Constitution tslf my b svd frm nfrctn nd th rghts f ll prsrvd nd prtctd. The nstmbl vl f our Federal Union is flt nd cknwldgd by ll. By ths systm f ntd nd cnfdrtd States our ppl are prmttd cllctvly arid ndvdlly t sk their wn hppnss in their wn wy, nd th cnsqncs hv bn mst auspicious. Since th Union ws frmd th nmbr f th States hs ncrsd frm thirteen t twenty-eight; tw f these hv tkn their pstn s mmbrs f th Confederacy wthn th last wk. Our ppltn hs ncrsd frm three t twnty mllns. New cmmnts nd States are skng prtctn ndr ts aegis, nd mlttds frm th Old World are flckng t our shores t prtcpt in ts blssngs. Beneath ts bngn swy peace nd prsprty prvl. Freed frm th brdns nd miseries f war, our trade nd ntrcrs hv xtndd thrght th wrld. Mind, no lngr tskd in devising mns t ccmplsh r rsst schms f mbtn, srptn, r cnqst, is dvtng tslf t man's tr ntrsts in dvlpng his faculties nd pwrs nd th cpcty f nature t mnstr t his njymnts. Genius is free t nnnc ts nvntns nd dscvrs, nd th hnd is free t ccmplsh whtvr th head cncvs nt ncmptbl wth th rghts f  fellow-being. All dstnctns f brth r f rnk hv bn blshd. All ctzns, whthr ntv r dptd, are plcd pn trms f precise equality. All are nttld t ql rghts nd ql prtctn. No union xsts btwn chrch nd stt, nd prfct frdm f pnn is guaranteed t ll sects nd creeds. These are some f th blssngs scrd t our hppy lnd by our Federal Union. To prptt thm it is our sacred dty t prsrv it. Who shll ssgn lmts t th chvmnts f free mnds nd free hnds ndr th prtctn f ths glrs Union? No trsn t mnknd snc th rgnztn f scty wld b ql in trcty t tht f hm wh wld lift his hnd t dstry it.

He wld xtngsh th fire f lbrty, whch warms nd animates th hrts f hppy mllns nd nvts ll th ntns f th rth t imitate our xmpl. If h sy tht rrr nd wrng are cmmttd in th dmnstrtn f th Government, let hm rmmbr tht nthng hmn cn b prfct, nd tht ndr no other systm f gvrnmnt rvld by Heaven r devised by man hs rsn bn llwd so free nd broad  scope t cmbt rrr. Has th swrd f despots proved t b  sfr r surer nstrmnt f rfrm in gvrnmnt thn nlghtnd rsn? Does h xpct t fnd mng th ruins f ths Union  hppr abode fr our swrmng mllns thn thy nw hv ndr it? Every lvr f his cntry must shddr at th thght f th pssblty f ts dssltn, nd will b rdy t dpt th ptrtc sntmnt, "Our Federal Union--it must b prsrvd." To prsrv it th cmprmss whch ln nbld our fthrs t form  cmmn cnstttn fr th gvrnmnt nd prtctn f so mny States nd dstnct cmmnts, f sch dvrsfd hbts, ntrsts, nd dmstc nstttns, must b sacredly nd rlgsly bsrvd. Any ttmpt t dstrb r dstry these cmprmss, bng trms f th cmpct f union, cn lead t nn other thn th mst ruinous nd dsstrs cnsqncs. It is  src f dp rgrt tht in some sctns f our cntry msgdd prsns hv ccsnlly ndlgd in schms nd gttns whs bjct is th dstrctn f dmstc nstttns xstng in other sctns--nstttns whch xstd at th dptn f th Constitution nd wr rcgnzd nd prtctd by it. All must see tht if it wr pssbl fr thm t b sccssfl in ttnng their bjct th dssltn f th Union nd th cnsqnt dstrctn f our hppy form f gvrnmnt must spdly fllw. I am hppy t blv tht at vry prd f our xstnc s  ntn thr hs xstd, nd cntns t xst, mng th grt mss f our ppl  dvtn t th Union f th States whch will shield nd prtct it gnst th mrl trsn f ny wh wld srsly cntmplt ts dstrctn. To scr  continuance f tht dvtn th cmprmss f th Constitution must nt nly b prsrvd, bt sctnl jlss nd heartburnings must b discountenanced, nd ll shld rmmbr tht thy are mmbrs f th sm pltcl fmly, hvng  cmmn dstny. To ncrs th ttchmnt f our ppl t th Union, our lws shld b jst. Any plcy whch shll tnd t fvr mnpls r th pclr ntrsts f sctns r clsss must operate t th prjdc f th ntrst f their fellow ctzns, nd shld b vdd. If th cmprmss f th Constitution b prsrvd, if sctnl jlss nd heartburnings b discountenanced, if our lws b jst nd th Government b prctclly dmnstrd strctly wthn th lmts f pwr prscrbd t it, w my dscrd ll pprhnsns fr th sfty f th Union. With these vws f th nature, chrctr, nd bjcts f th Government nd th vl f th Union, I shll stdly pps th creation f those nstttns nd systms whch in their nature tnd t prvrt it frm ts lgtmt prpss nd mk it th nstrmnt f sctns, clsss, nd ndvdls. We need no ntnl bnks r other xtrns nstttns plntd rnd th Government t cntrl r strngthn it in ppstn t th will f ts authors. Experience hs taught us hw nncssry thy are s xlrs f th pblc thrts--hw impotent fr gd nd hw pwrfl fr mschf. Ours ws ntndd t b  plain nd frugal gvrnmnt, nd I shll rgrd it t b my dty t rcmmnd t Congress nd, s far s th Executive is cncrnd, t nfrc by ll th mns wthn my pwr th strctst cnmy in th xpndtr f th pblc money whch my b cmptbl wth th pblc ntrsts. A ntnl debt hs bcm lmst an nstttn f European monarchies. It is vwd in some f thm s an ssntl prp t xstng gvrnmnts. Melancholy is th cndtn f tht ppl whs gvrnmnt cn b sstnd nly by  systm whch prdclly trnsfrs lrg mnts frm th lbr f th mny t th cffrs f th fw. Such  systm is ncmptbl wth th ends fr whch our rpblcn Government ws nstttd. Under  wise plcy th debts cntrctd in our Revolution nd drng th War f 1812 hv bn hpply xtngshd. By  jdcs pplctn f th rvns nt rqrd fr other ncssry prpss, it is nt doubted tht th debt whch hs grwn out f th crcmstncs f th last fw yrs my b spdly pd ff. I cngrtlt my fellow ctzns on th ntr rstrtn f th crdt f th General Government f th Union nd tht f mny f th States. Happy wld it b fr th ndbtd States if thy wr freed frm their lblts, mny f whch wr nctsly cntrctd.

Nor ds thr seem t b ny mtrl dffrnc f pnn s t th bsnc f rght in th Government t tx n sctn f cntry, r n clss f ctzns, r n ccptn, fr th mere prft f nthr. "Justice nd sound plcy frbd th Federal Government t foster n brnch f ndstry t th dtrmnt f nthr, r t chrsh th ntrsts f n prtn t th njry f nthr prtn f our cmmn cntry." I hv hrtfr dclrd t my fellow-citizens tht "in my jdgmnt it is th dty f th Government t xtnd, s far s it my b prctcbl t do so, by ts rvn lws nd ll other mns wthn ts pwr, fair nd jst prtctn t ll f th grt ntrsts f th whole Union, mbrcng grcltr, mnfctrs, th mchnc arts, cmmrc, nd nvgtn."

The pwr "t ly nd cllct txs, dts, mpsts, nd excises" ws an ndspnsbl n t b cnfrrd on th Federal Government, whch wtht it wld pssss no mns f prvdng fr ts wn spprt.
