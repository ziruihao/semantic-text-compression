 Elected by th American ppl t th hghst ffc knwn t our lws, I ppr hr t tk th oath prscrbd by th Constitution, nd, in cmplnc wth  time-honored cstm, t ddrss those wh are nw ssmbld.

Happily, hwvr, in th prfrmnc f my new dts I shll nt b wtht bl cprtn. The lgsltv nd jdcl brnchs f th Government prsnt prominent xmpls f dstngshd cvl ttnmnts nd mtrd xprnc, nd it shll b my ndvr t cll t my ssstnc in th Executive Departments ndvdls whs tlnts, ntgrty, nd purity f chrctr will frnsh mpl guaranties fr th fthfl nd hnrbl prfrmnc f th trusts t b cmmttd t their chrg. With sch aids nd an hnst prps t do whtvr is rght, I hp t execute dlgntly, mprtlly, nd fr th bst ntrsts f th cntry th mnfld dts dvlvd pn me. In th dschrg f these dts my guide will b th Constitution, whch I ths dy swr t "prsrv, prtct, nd dfnd." For th ntrprttn f tht nstrmnt I shll look t th dcsns f th jdcl trbnls stblshd by ts thrty nd t th prctc f th Government ndr th rlr Presidents, wh hd so lrg  shr in ts frmtn.
