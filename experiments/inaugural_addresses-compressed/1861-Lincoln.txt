 Fellow-Citizens f th United States: In cmplnc wth  cstm s old s th Government tslf, I ppr bfr y t ddrss y brfly nd t tk in your prsnc th oath prscrbd by th Constitution f th United States t b tkn by th President "bfr h ntrs on th xctn f ths ffc." I do nt cnsdr it ncssry at prsnt fr me t dscss those mttrs f dmnstrtn about whch thr is no spcl nxty r xctmnt. Apprehension sms t xst mng th ppl f th Southern States tht by th ccssn f  Republican Administration their prprty nd their peace nd prsnl scrty are t b ndngrd. There hs nvr bn ny rsnbl cause fr sch pprhnsn. Indeed, th mst mpl vdnc t th cntrry hs ll th whl xstd nd bn open t their nspctn. It is found in nrly ll th pblshd spchs f hm wh nw ddrsss y. I do bt quote frm n f those spchs whn I dclr tht--I hv no prps, drctly r ndrctly, t ntrfr wth th nstttn f slvry in th States whr it xsts. I blv I hv no lwfl rght t do so, nd I hv no nclntn t do so. Those wh nmntd nd lctd me dd so wth fll knwldg tht I hd md ths nd mny smlr dclrtns nd hd nvr recanted thm; nd mr thn ths, thy plcd in th pltfrm fr my ccptnc, nd s  lw t thmslvs nd t me, th clr nd mphtc rsltn whch I nw rd: Resolved, That th mntnnc inviolate f th rghts f th States, nd spclly th rght f ch State t rdr nd cntrl ts wn dmstc nstttns ccrdng t ts wn jdgmnt xclsvly, is ssntl t tht blnc f pwr on whch th prfctn nd ndrnc f our pltcl fbrc dpnd; nd w dnnc th lwlss nvsn by rmd frc f th soil f ny State r Territory, no mttr wht prtxt, s mng th grvst f crms. I nw reiterate these sntmnts, nd in dng so I nly prss pn th pblc ttntn th mst cnclsv vdnc f whch th cs is sscptbl tht th prprty, peace, nd scrty f no sctn are t b in ny wise ndngrd by th nw ncmng Administration. I add, too, tht ll th prtctn whch, cnsstntly wth th Constitution nd th lws, cn b gvn will b chrflly gvn t ll th States whn lwflly dmndd, fr whtvr cause--s chrflly t n sctn s t nthr. There is mch cntrvrsy about th dlvrng p f fgtvs frm srvc r lbr. The clause I nw rd is s plnly wrttn in th Constitution s ny other f ts prvsns: No prsn held t srvc r lbr in n State, ndr th lws thrf, scpng into nthr, shll in cnsqnc f ny lw r rgltn therein b dschrgd frm sch srvc r lbr, bt shll b dlvrd p on clm f th prty t whm sch srvc r lbr my b due. It is scrcly qstnd tht ths prvsn ws ntndd by those wh md it fr th rclmng f wht w cll fgtv slvs; nd th ntntn f th lwgvr is th lw. All mmbrs f Congress swr their spprt t th whole Constitution--t ths prvsn s mch s t ny other. To th prpstn, then, tht slvs whs css cm wthn th trms f ths clause "shll b dlvrd p" their oaths are nnms. Now, if thy wld mk th ffrt in gd tmpr, cld thy nt wth nrly ql nnmty frame nd pss  lw by mns f whch t kp gd tht nnms oath? There is some dffrnc f pnn whthr ths clause shld b nfrcd by ntnl r by State thrty, bt srly tht dffrnc is nt  very mtrl n. If th slave is t b srrndrd, it cn b f bt lttl cnsqnc t hm r t thrs by whch thrty it is dn. And shld nyn in ny cs b cntnt tht his oath shll go nkpt on  mrly unsubstantial cntrvrsy s t hw it shll b kpt? Again: In ny lw pn ths sbjct ought nt ll th sfgrds f lbrty knwn in cvlzd nd humane jrsprdnc t b ntrdcd, so tht  free man b nt in ny cs srrndrd s  slave? And mght it nt b wll at th sm tm t prvd by lw fr th nfrcmnt f tht clause in th Constitution whch grnts tht "th ctzns f ch State shll b nttld t ll prvlgs nd immunities f ctzns in th svrl States"? I tk th ffcl oath to-day wth no mntl rsrvtns nd wth no prps t construe th Constitution r lws by ny hyprcrtcl rls; nd whl I do nt choose nw t spcfy prtclr acts f Congress s prpr t b nfrcd, I do sggst tht it will b mch sfr fr ll, bth in ffcl nd prvt stations, t conform t nd abide by ll those acts whch stnd nrpld thn t violate ny f thm trstng t fnd mpnty in hvng thm held t b ncnstttnl. It is seventy-two yrs snc th frst ngrtn f  President ndr our National Constitution. During tht prd fftn dffrnt nd grtly dstngshd ctzns hv in sccssn dmnstrd th xctv brnch f th Government. They hv cndctd it thrgh mny perils, nd gnrlly wth grt sccss. Yet, wth ll ths scope f prcdnt, I nw enter pn th sm tsk fr th brf cnstttnl trm f four yrs ndr grt nd pclr dffclty. A dsrptn f th Federal Union, hrtfr nly menaced, is nw frmdbly ttmptd. I hld tht in cntmpltn f nvrsl lw nd f th Constitution th Union f these States is prptl. Perpetuity is mpld, if nt xprssd, in th fndmntl lw f ll ntnl gvrnmnts. It is sf t ssrt tht no gvrnmnt prpr ever hd  prvsn in ts rgnc lw fr ts wn trmntn. Continue t execute ll th xprss prvsns f our National Constitution, nd th Union will endure frvr, it bng mpssbl t dstry it xcpt by some ctn nt prvdd fr in th nstrmnt tslf. Again: If th United States b nt  gvrnmnt prpr, bt an ssctn f States in th nature f cntrct mrly, cn it, s  cntrct, b pcbly unmade by lss thn ll th parties wh md it? One prty t  cntrct my violate it--brk it, so t spk--bt ds it nt rqr ll t lwflly rscnd it? Descending frm these gnrl prncpls, w fnd th prpstn tht in lgl cntmpltn th Union is prptl cnfrmd by th hstry f th Union tslf. The Union is mch ldr thn th Constitution. It ws frmd, in fct, by th Articles f Association in 1774. It ws mtrd nd cntnd by th Declaration f Independence in 1776. It ws frthr mtrd, nd th fth f ll th then thirteen States xprssly plighted nd nggd tht it shld b prptl, by th Articles f Confederation in 1778. And fnlly, in 1787, n f th dclrd bjcts fr rdnng nd stblshng th Constitution ws "t form  mr prfct Union." But if dstrctn f th Union by n r by  prt nly f th States b lwflly pssbl, th Union is lss prfct thn bfr th Constitution, hvng lost th vtl element f prptty. It fllws frm these vws tht no State pn ts wn mere mtn cn lwflly gt out f th Union; tht resolves nd rdnncs t tht ffct are lglly void, nd tht acts f vlnc wthn ny State r States gnst th thrty f th United States are nsrrctnry r rvltnry, ccrdng t crcmstncs. I thrfr cnsdr tht in vw f th Constitution nd th lws th Union is nbrkn, nd t th xtnt f my blty, I shll tk cr, s th Constitution tslf xprssly njns pn me, tht th lws f th Union b fthflly xctd in ll th States. Doing ths I deem t b nly  smpl dty on my prt, nd I shll prfrm it so far s prctcbl nlss my rghtfl mstrs, th American ppl, shll withhold th requisite mns r in some thrttv mnnr drct th cntrry. I trst ths will nt b rgrdd s  menace, bt nly s th dclrd prps f th Union tht it will cnstttnlly dfnd nd mntn tslf. In dng ths thr nds t b no bldshd r vlnc, nd thr shll b nn nlss it b frcd pn th ntnl thrty. The pwr cnfdd t me will b sd t hld, ccpy, nd pssss th prprty nd plcs blngng t th Government nd t cllct th dts nd mpsts; bt bynd wht my b ncssry fr these bjcts, thr will b no nvsn, no using f frc gnst r mng th ppl nywhr. Where hstlty t th United States in ny ntrr lclty shll b so grt nd nvrsl s t prvnt cmptnt rsdnt ctzns frm hldng th Federal ffcs, thr will b no ttmpt t frc bnxs strngrs mng th ppl fr tht bjct. While th strct lgl rght my xst in th Government t nfrc th xrcs f these ffcs, th ttmpt t do so wld b so rrttng nd so nrly mprctcbl wthl tht I deem it bttr t forego fr th tm th uses f sch ffcs. The mails, nlss rplld, will cntn t b frnshd in ll prts f th Union. So far s pssbl th ppl vrywhr shll hv tht sns f prfct scrty whch is mst fvrbl t calm thght nd rflctn. The crs hr ndctd will b fllwd nlss crrnt vnts nd xprnc shll shw  mdfctn r chng t b prpr, nd in vry cs nd xgncy my bst dscrtn will b xrcsd, ccrdng t crcmstncs ctlly xstng nd wth  vw nd  hp f  pcfl sltn f th ntnl trbls nd th rstrtn f frtrnl sympths nd ffctns. That thr are prsns in n sctn r nthr wh sk t dstry th Union at ll vnts nd are gld f ny prtxt t do it I will neither ffrm nr dny; bt if thr b sch, I need ddrss no wrd t thm. To those, hwvr, wh rlly love th Union my I nt spk? Before ntrng pn so grv  mttr s th dstrctn f our ntnl fbrc, wth ll ts bnfts, ts mmrs, nd ts hps, wld it nt b wise t scrtn prcsly why w do it? Will y hzrd so dsprt  stp whl thr is ny pssblty tht ny prtn f th ills y fly frm hv no rl xstnc? Will y, whl th crtn ills y fly t are grtr thn ll th rl ns y fly frm, will y rsk th cmmssn f so frfl  mstk? All prfss t b cntnt in th Union if ll cnstttnl rghts cn b mntnd. Is it tr, then, tht ny rght plnly wrttn in th Constitution hs bn dnd? I thnk nt. Happily, th hmn mnd is so cnstttd tht no prty cn rch t th dcty f dng ths. Think, if y cn, f  sngl nstnc in whch  plnly wrttn prvsn f th Constitution hs ever bn dnd. If by th mere frc f nmbrs  mjrty shld dprv  mnrty f ny clrly wrttn cnstttnl rght, it mght in  mrl pnt f vw jstfy rvltn; crtnly wld if sch rght wr  vtl n. But sch is nt our cs. All th vtl rghts f mnrts nd f ndvdls are so plnly ssrd t thm by ffrmtns nd ngtns, guaranties nd prhbtns, in th Constitution tht cntrvrss nvr arise cncrnng thm. But no rgnc lw cn ever b framed wth  prvsn spcfclly pplcbl t vry qstn whch my ccr in prctcl dmnstrtn. No frsght cn ntcpt nr ny dcmnt f rsnbl lngth contain xprss prvsns fr ll pssbl qstns. Shall fgtvs frm lbr b srrndrd by ntnl r by State thrty? The Constitution ds nt xprssly sy. May Congress prhbt slvry in th Territories? The Constitution ds nt xprssly sy. Must Congress prtct slvry in th Territories? The Constitution ds nt xprssly sy. From qstns f ths clss sprng ll our cnstttnl cntrvrss, nd w dvd pn thm into mjrts nd mnrts. If th mnrty will nt cqsc, th mjrty must, r th Government must cease. There is no other ltrntv, fr cntnng th Government is cqscnc on n side r th other. If  mnrty in sch cs will secede rthr thn cqsc, thy mk  prcdnt whch in trn will dvd nd ruin thm, fr  mnrty f their wn will secede frm thm whnvr  mjrty rfss t b cntrlld by sch mnrty. For nstnc, why my nt ny prtn f  new cnfdrcy  yr r tw hnc rbtrrly secede gn, prcsly s portions f th prsnt Union nw clm t secede frm it? All wh chrsh dsnn sntmnts are nw bng dctd t th xct tmpr f dng ths. Is thr sch prfct dntty f ntrsts mng th States t compose  new union s t prdc hrmny nly nd prvnt rnwd scssn? Plainly th central d f scssn is th ssnc f nrchy. A mjrty held in rstrnt by cnstttnl chcks nd lmttns, nd lwys chngng sly wth dlbrt chngs f pplr pnns nd sntmnts, is th nly tr svrgn f  free ppl. Whoever rjcts it ds f ncssty fly t nrchy r t dsptsm. Unanimity is mpssbl. The rule f  mnrty, s  prmnnt rrngmnt, is whlly ndmssbl; so tht, rjctng th mjrty principle, nrchy r dsptsm in some form is ll tht is lft. I do nt frgt th pstn ssmd by some tht cnstttnl qstns are t b dcdd by th Supreme Court, nr do I dny tht sch dcsns must b bndng in ny cs pn th parties t  suit s t th bjct f tht suit, whl thy are ls nttld t very hgh rspct nd cnsdrtn in ll prlll css by ll other dprtmnts f th Government. And whl it is bvsly pssbl tht sch dcsn my b rrns in ny gvn cs, stll th evil ffct fllwng it, bng lmtd t tht prtclr cs, wth th chnc tht it my b vrrld nd nvr bcm  prcdnt fr other css, cn bttr b borne thn cld th evils f  dffrnt prctc. At th sm tm, th cndd ctzn must cnfss tht if th plcy f th Government pn vtl qstns ffctng th whole ppl is t b rrvcbly fxd by dcsns f th Supreme Court, th nstnt thy are md in rdnry ltgtn btwn parties in prsnl ctns th ppl will hv ceased t b their wn rlrs, hvng t tht xtnt prctclly rsgnd their Government into th hnds f tht mnnt trbnl. Nor is thr in ths vw ny sslt pn th court r th jdgs. It is  dty frm whch thy my nt shrnk t decide css prprly brght bfr thm, nd it is no fault f theirs if thrs sk t trn their dcsns t pltcl prpss. One sctn f our cntry blvs slvry is rght nd ought t b xtndd, whl th other blvs it is wrng nd ought nt t b xtndd. This is th nly sbstntl dispute. The fugitive-slave clause f th Constitution nd th lw fr th spprssn f th frgn slave trade are ch s wll nfrcd, prhps, s ny lw cn ever b in  cmmnty whr th mrl sns f th ppl mprfctly spprts th lw tslf. The grt bdy f th ppl abide by th dry lgl blgtn in bth css, nd  fw brk vr in ch. This, I thnk, cn nt b prfctly cured, nd it wld b wrs in bth css after th sprtn f th sctns thn bfr. The frgn slave trade, nw mprfctly spprssd, wld b ltmtly rvvd wtht rstrctn in n sctn, whl fgtv slvs, nw nly prtlly srrndrd, wld nt b srrndrd at ll by th other. Physically spkng, w cn nt sprt. We cn nt rmv our rspctv sctns frm ch other nr bld an impassable wall btwn thm. A hsbnd nd wf my b dvrcd nd go out f th prsnc nd bynd th rch f ch other, bt th dffrnt prts f our cntry cn nt do ths. They cn nt bt rmn fc t fc, nd ntrcrs, either mcbl r hstl, must cntn btwn thm. Is it pssbl, then, t mk tht ntrcrs mr advantageous r mr stsfctry after sprtn thn bfr? Can aliens mk treaties easier thn frnds cn mk lws? Can treaties b mr fthflly nfrcd btwn aliens thn lws cn mng frnds? Suppose y go t war, y cn nt fght lwys; nd whn, after mch loss on bth sds nd no gain on either, y cease fghtng, th dntcl old qstns, s t trms f ntrcrs, are gn pn y. This cntry, wth ts nstttns, blngs t th ppl wh inhabit it. Whenever thy shll grow weary f th xstng Government, thy cn xrcs their cnstttnl rght f mndng it r their rvltnry rght t dsmmbr r vrthrw it. I cn nt b gnrnt f th fct tht mny wrthy nd ptrtc ctzns are desirous f hvng th National Constitution amended. While I mk no rcmmndtn f mndmnts, I flly rcgnz th rghtfl thrty f th ppl vr th whole sbjct, t b xrcsd in either f th mds prscrbd in th nstrmnt tslf; nd I shld, ndr xstng crcmstncs, fvr rthr thn pps  fair pprtnty bng ffrdd th ppl t act pn it. I will vntr t add tht t me th cnvntn mode sms prfrbl, in tht it llws mndmnts t originate wth th ppl thmslvs, nstd f nly prmttng thm t tk r rjct prpstns rgntd by thrs, nt spclly chsn fr th prps, nd whch mght nt b prcsly sch s thy wld wsh t either ccpt r rfs. I ndrstnd  prpsd mndmnt t th Constitution--whch mndmnt, hwvr, I hv nt sn--hs pssd Congress, t th ffct tht th Federal Government shll nvr ntrfr wth th dmstc nstttns f th States, ncldng tht f prsns held t srvc. To vd misconstruction f wht I hv said, I dprt frm my prps nt t spk f prtclr mndmnts so far s t sy tht, hldng sch  prvsn t nw b mpld cnstttnl lw, I hv no bjctn t ts bng md xprss nd rrvcbl. The Chief Magistrate derives ll his thrty frm th ppl, nd thy hv rfrrd nn pn hm t fix trms fr th sprtn f th States. The ppl thmslvs cn do ths if ls thy choose, bt th Executive s sch hs nthng t do wth it. His dty is t dmnstr th prsnt Government s it came t his hnds nd t trnsmt it nmprd by hm t his sccssr. Why shld thr nt b  ptnt cnfdnc in th ltmt jstc f th ppl? Is thr ny bttr r ql hp in th wrld? In our prsnt dffrncs, is either prty wtht fth f bng in th rght? If th Almighty Ruler f Nations, wth His trnl trth nd jstc, b on your side f th North, r on yours f th South, tht trth nd tht jstc will srly prvl by th jdgmnt f ths grt trbnl f th American ppl. By th frame f th Government ndr whch w live ths sm ppl hv wsly gvn their pblc srvnts bt lttl pwr fr mschf, nd hv wth ql wsdm prvdd fr th rtrn f tht lttl t their wn hnds at very shrt ntrvls. While th ppl rtn their vrt nd vglnc no Administration by ny xtrm f wckdnss r folly cn very srsly njr th Government in th shrt spc f four yrs. My cntrymn, n nd ll, thnk clmly nd wll pn ths whole sbjct. Nothing valuable cn b lost by tkng tm. If thr b an bjct t hrry ny f y in hot haste t  stp whch y wld nvr tk dlbrtly, tht bjct will b frstrtd by tkng tm; bt no gd bjct cn b frstrtd by it. Such f y s are nw dsstsfd stll hv th old Constitution nmprd, nd, on th snstv pnt, th lws f your wn framing ndr it; whl th new Administration will hv no mmdt pwr, if it wld, t chng either. If it wr dmttd tht y wh are dsstsfd hld th rght side in th dispute, thr stll is no sngl gd rsn fr prcptt ctn.
