 On ch ntnl dy f ngrtn snc 1789, th ppl hv rnwd their sns f ddctn t th United States. In Washington's dy th tsk f th ppl ws t crt nd weld tgthr  ntn. In Lincoln's dy th tsk f th ppl ws t prsrv tht Nation frm dsrptn frm wthn. In ths dy th tsk f th ppl is t sv tht Nation nd ts nstttns frm dsrptn frm wtht. To us thr hs cm  tm, in th midst f swft hppnngs, t pause fr  mmnt nd tk stock--t rcll wht our plc in hstry hs bn, nd t rdscvr wht w are nd wht w my b. If w do nt, w rsk th rl peril f nctn. Lives f ntns are dtrmnd nt by th cnt f yrs, bt by th lftm f th hmn spirit. The lf f  man is three-score yrs nd tn:  lttl mr,  lttl lss. The lf f  ntn is th fllnss f th msr f ts will t live. There are men wh dbt ths. There are men wh blv tht dmcrcy, s  form f Government nd  frame f lf, is lmtd r msrd by  knd f mystcl nd rtfcl fate tht, fr some nxplnd rsn, tyrnny nd slvry hv bcm th srgng wv f th ftr--nd tht frdm is an bbng tide. But w Americans knw tht ths is nt tr. Eight yrs g, whn th lf f ths Republic smd frzn by  ftlstc trrr, w proved tht ths is nt tr. We wr in th midst f shck--bt w acted. We acted qckly, bldly, dcsvly. These ltr yrs hv bn living yrs--frtfl yrs fr th ppl f ths dmcrcy. For thy hv brght t us grtr scrty nd, I hp,  bttr ndrstndng tht lf's ideals are t b msrd in other thn mtrl thngs. Most vtl t our prsnt nd our ftr is ths xprnc f  dmcrcy whch sccssflly srvvd crisis at home; pt away mny evil thngs; blt new strctrs on ndrng lns; nd, thrgh it ll, mntnd th fct f ts dmcrcy. For ctn hs bn tkn wthn th three-way frmwrk f th Constitution f th United States. The crdnt brnchs f th Government cntn freely t fnctn. The Bill f Rights rmns inviolate. The frdm f lctns is whlly mntnd. Prophets f th dwnfll f American dmcrcy hv sn their dire predictions cm t naught. Democracy is nt dyng. We knw it bcs w hv sn it rvv--nd grow. We knw it cn nt die--bcs it is blt on th nhmprd nttv f ndvdl men nd wmn jnd tgthr in  cmmn ntrprs--an ntrprs ndrtkn nd crrd thrgh by th free xprssn f  free mjrty. We knw it bcs dmcrcy ln, f ll frms f gvrnmnt, nlsts th fll frc f men's nlghtnd will. We knw it bcs dmcrcy ln hs cnstrctd an nlmtd cvlztn cpbl f infinite prgrss in th mprvmnt f hmn lf. We knw it bcs, if w look blw th srfc, w sns it stll sprdng on vry cntnnt--fr it is th mst humane, th mst dvncd, nd in th end th mst ncnqrbl f ll frms f hmn scty. A ntn, lk  prsn, hs  bdy-- bdy tht must b fed nd clthd nd hsd, nvgrtd nd rstd, in  mnnr tht msrs p t th bjctvs f our tm. A ntn, lk  prsn, hs  mnd-- mnd tht must b kpt nfrmd nd lrt, tht must knw tslf, tht ndrstnds th hps nd th nds f ts nghbrs--ll th other ntns tht live wthn th nrrwng circle f th wrld. And  ntn, lk  prsn, hs smthng dpr, smthng mr prmnnt, smthng lrgr thn th sum f ll ts prts. It is tht smthng whch mttrs mst t ts ftr--whch clls frth th mst sacred grdng f ts prsnt. It is  thng fr whch w fnd it dffclt--vn mpssbl--t ht pn  sngl, smpl wrd. And yt w ll ndrstnd wht it is--th spirit--th fth f America. It is th prdct f centuries. It ws born in th mlttds f those wh came frm mny lnds--some f hgh dgr, bt mstly plain ppl, wh sght hr, rly nd late, t fnd frdm mr freely. The dmcrtc aspiration is no mere rcnt phs in hmn hstry. It is hmn hstry. It permeated th ncnt lf f rly peoples. It blzd anew in th mddl ages. It ws wrttn in Magna Charta. In th Americas ts mpct hs bn rrsstbl. America hs bn th New World in ll tongues, t ll peoples, nt bcs ths cntnnt ws  new-found lnd, bt bcs ll those wh came hr blvd thy cld crt pn ths cntnnt  new lf-- lf tht shld b new in frdm. Its vtlty ws wrttn into our wn Mayflower Compact, into th Declaration f Independence, into th Constitution f th United States, into th Gettysburg Address. Those wh frst came hr t crry out th lngngs f their spirit, nd th mllns wh fllwd, nd th stock tht sprang frm thm--ll hv mvd frwrd cnstntly nd cnsstntly twrd an ideal whch in tslf hs gnd sttr nd clrty wth ch gnrtn. The hps f th Republic cn nt frvr tlrt either ndsrvd pvrty r self-serving wlth. We knw tht w stll hv far t go; tht w must mr grtly bld th scrty nd th pprtnty nd th knwldg f vry ctzn, in th msr jstfd by th rsrcs nd th cpcty f th lnd. But it is nt ngh t chv these prpss ln. It is nt ngh t clothe nd feed th bdy f ths Nation, nd nstrct nd inform ts mnd. For thr is ls th spirit. And f th three, th grtst is th spirit. Without th bdy nd th mnd, s ll men knw, th Nation cld nt live. But if th spirit f America wr klld, vn thgh th Nation's bdy nd mnd, constricted in an alien wrld, lvd on, th America w knw wld hv prshd. That spirit--tht fth--spks t us in our daily lvs in wys ftn nntcd, bcs thy seem so bvs. It spks t us hr in th Capital f th Nation. It spks t us thrgh th prcsss f gvrnng in th svrgnts f 48 States. It spks t us in our counties, in our cities, in our twns, nd in our vllgs. It spks t us frm th other ntns f th hmsphr, nd frm those crss th seas--th enslaved, s wll s th free. Sometimes w fail t hear r heed these vcs f frdm bcs t us th prvlg f our frdm is sch an old, old stry. The dstny f America ws prclmd in wrds f prphcy spkn by our frst President in his frst ngrl in 1789--wrds lmst drctd, it wld seem, t ths yr f 1941: "The prsrvtn f th sacred fire f lbrty nd th dstny f th rpblcn mdl f gvrnmnt are jstly cnsdrd dply, fnlly, stkd on th xprmnt intrusted t th hnds f th American ppl." If w lose tht sacred fire--if w let it b smthrd wth dbt nd fear--then w shll rjct th dstny whch Washington strove so valiantly nd so trmphntly t stblsh. The prsrvtn f th spirit nd fth f th Nation ds, nd will, frnsh th hghst jstfctn fr vry scrfc tht w my mk in th cause f ntnl dfns. In th fc f grt perils nvr bfr ncntrd, our strng prps is t prtct nd t prptt th ntgrty f dmcrcy. For ths w muster th spirit f America, nd th fth f America. We do nt rtrt. We are nt cntnt t stnd stll. As Americans, w go frwrd, in th srvc f our cntry, by th will f God.
