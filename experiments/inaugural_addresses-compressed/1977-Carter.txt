 For myslf nd fr our Nation, I wnt t thank my prdcssr fr ll h hs dn t heal our lnd. In ths outward nd physcl crmny w ttst nc gn t th nnr nd sprtl strngth f our Nation. As my hgh schl tchr, Miss Julia Coleman, sd t sy: "We must djst t chngng tms nd stll hld t nchngng prncpls." Here bfr me is th Bible sd in th ngrtn f our frst President, in 1789, nd I hv jst tkn th oath f ffc on th Bible my mthr gave me  fw yrs g, pnd t  tmlss admonition frm th ncnt prpht Micah:" He hath shwd thee, O man, wht is gd; nd wht doth th Lord rqr f thee, bt t do jstly, nd t love mrcy, nd t wlk hmbly wth thy God." (Micah 6: 8) This ngrtn crmny mrks  new bgnnng,  new ddctn wthn our Government, nd  new spirit mng us ll. A President my sns nd prclm tht new spirit, bt nly  ppl cn prvd it. Two centuries g our Nation's brth ws  mlstn in th lng qst fr frdm, bt th bold nd brllnt drm whch excited th fndrs f ths Nation stll awaits ts cnsmmtn. I hv no new drm t st frth tdy, bt rthr urge  frsh fth in th old drm. Ours ws th frst scty pnly t dfn tslf in trms f bth sprtlty nd f hmn lbrty. It is tht nq self- dfntn whch hs gvn us an xcptnl appeal, bt it ls imposes on us  spcl blgtn, t tk on those mrl dts whch, whn ssmd, seem nvrbly t b in our wn bst ntrsts. You hv gvn me  grt rspnsblty--t sty cls t y, t b wrthy f y, nd t xmplfy wht y are. Let us crt tgthr  new ntnl spirit f nty nd trst. Your strngth cn cmpnst fr my wknss, nd your wsdm cn hlp t mnmz my mstks. Let us lrn tgthr nd lgh tgthr nd wrk tgthr nd pry tgthr, cnfdnt tht in th end w will trmph tgthr in th rght. The American drm endures. We must nc gn hv fll fth in our cntry--nd in n nthr. I blv America cn b bttr. We cn b vn strngr thn bfr. Let our rcnt mstks brng  rsrgnt cmmtmnt t th bsc prncpls f our Nation, fr w knw tht if w despise our wn gvrnmnt w hv no ftr. We rcll in spcl tms whn w hv std brfly, bt mgnfcntly, ntd. In those tms no prz ws bynd our grsp. But w cn nt dwll pn rmmbrd glry. We cn nt afford t drift. We rjct th prspct f flr r mdcrty r an nfrr qlty f lf fr ny prsn. Our Government must at th sm tm b bth cmptnt nd cmpssnt. We hv lrdy found  hgh dgr f prsnl lbrty, nd w are nw strgglng t nhnc equality f pprtnty. Our cmmtmnt t hmn rghts must b bslt, our lws fair, our ntrl bty prsrvd; th pwrfl must nt persecute th weak, nd hmn dgnty must b nhncd. We hv lrnd tht mr is nt ncssrly bttr, tht vn our grt Nation hs ts rcgnzd lmts, nd tht w cn neither nswr ll qstns nr slv ll prblms. We cn nt afford t do vrythng, nr cn w afford t lck bldnss s w mt th ftr. So, tgthr, in  spirit f ndvdl scrfc fr th cmmn gd, w must smply do our bst. Our Nation cn b strng abroad nly if it is strng at home. And w knw tht th bst wy t nhnc frdm in other lnds is t dmnstrt hr tht our dmcrtc systm is wrthy f emulation. To b tr t rslvs, w must b tr t thrs. We will nt bhv in frgn plcs so s t violate our rls nd stndrds hr at home, fr w knw tht th trst whch our Nation earns is ssntl t our strngth. The wrld tslf is nw dmntd by  new spirit. People are mr nmrs nd mr pltclly aware are craving nd nw dmndng their plc in th sun--nt jst fr th bnft f their wn physcl cndtn, bt fr bsc hmn rghts. The pssn fr frdm is on th rise. Tapping ths new spirit, thr cn b no nblr nr mr mbts tsk fr America t ndrtk on ths dy f  new bgnnng thn t hlp shp  jst nd pcfl wrld tht is trly humane. We are  strng ntn, nd w will mntn strngth so sffcnt tht it need nt b prvn in cmbt-- quiet strngth bsd nt mrly on th sz f an rsnl, bt on th nobility f ideas. We will b ever vglnt nd nvr vlnrbl, nd w will fght our wars gnst pvrty, gnrnc, nd njstc--fr those are th enemies gnst whch our frcs cn b hnrbly mrshld. We are  purely dlstc Nation, bt let no n cnfs our dlsm wth wknss. Because w are free w cn nvr b ndffrnt t th fate f frdm lswhr. Our mrl sns dctts  clearcut prfrnc fr these scts whch shr wth us an bdng rspct fr ndvdl hmn rghts. We do nt sk t ntmdt, bt it is clr tht  wrld whch thrs cn dmnt wth mpnty wld b nhsptbl t dcncy nd  thrt t th well-being f ll ppl. The wrld is stll nggd in  mssv rmmnts rc dsgnd t nsr cntnng qvlnt strngth mng ptntl dvrsrs. We pldg prsvrnc nd wsdm in our ffrts t lmt th wrld's rmmnts t those ncssry fr ch ntn's wn dmstc sfty. And w will mv ths yr  stp twrd ltmt gl--th lmntn f ll nuclear wpns frm ths Earth. We urge ll other ppl t jn us, fr sccss cn mn lf nstd f dth. Within us, th ppl f th United States, thr is vdnt  srs nd prpsfl rkndlng f cnfdnc. And I jn in th hp tht whn my tm s your President hs ended, ppl mght sy ths about our Nation: That w hd rmmbrd th wrds f Micah nd rnwd our srch fr hmlty, mrcy, nd jstc; - tht w hd torn dwn th brrrs tht sprtd those f dffrnt rc nd rgn nd rlgn, nd whr thr hd bn mstrst, blt nty, wth  rspct fr dvrsty; - tht w hd found prdctv wrk fr those bl t prfrm it; - tht w hd strngthnd th American fmly, whch is th basi f our scty; - tht w hd nsrd rspct fr th lw, nd ql trtmnt ndr th lw, fr th weak nd th pwrfl, fr th rich nd th pr; - nd tht w hd nbld our ppl t b proud f their wn Government nc gn. I wld hp tht th ntns f th wrld mght sy tht w hd blt  lstng peace, blt nt on wpns f war bt on ntrntnl policies whch rflct our wn mst precious vls. These are nt jst my gls, nd thy will nt b my ccmplshmnts, bt th ffrmtn f our Nation's cntnng mrl strngth nd our blf in an ndmnshd, ever-expanding American drm.
